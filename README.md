# Goal
The goal of this project is predict the primary code type used in a GitHub repository based on the text contained within a readme. For this, the team decided to manually find 20 repos who's main coding language, as determined by GitHub and had at least 50%, is of the following type:

  * HTML

The team decided to pull it's sample of GitRepos from various news media organizations.
