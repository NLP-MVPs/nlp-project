# Goal
The goal of this project is predict the primary code type used in a GitHub repository based on the text contained within a readme. For this, the team decided to manually find 229 repos who's main coding language, as determined by GitHub and had at least 50%, is of the following type:
  
  * Javascript
  * Python

We will also deliver the following:

  * A Jupyter notebook containing detailing to every step of this project
  * A 5-minute presentation about the project, including slides


# Wrangle

The team decided to pull it's sample of GitRepos from various news media organizations.
