It is run by a donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.\nOur full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.\nTable of Contents\n\nCertifications\nThe Learning Platform\nReporting Bugs and Issues\nReporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure\nContributing\nPlatform, Build and Deployment Status\nLicense\n\nCertifications\nfreeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.\nEach of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.\nYou can pull in these test suites through freeCodeCamp's CDN. This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local computer's development environment.\nOnce you\u2019ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or r\u00e9sum\u00e9. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they\u2019ll see a verified certification specific to you.\nThe one exception to this is if we discover violations of our Academic Honesty Policy. When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.\nHere are our ten core certifications:\n1. Responsive Web Design Certification\n\nBasic HTML and HTML5\nBasic CSS\nApplied Visual Design\nApplied Accessibility\nResponsive Web Design Principles\nCSS Flexbox\nCSS Grid\n\n\nProjects: Tribute Page, Survey Form, Product Landing Page, Technical Documentation Page, Personal Portfolio Webpage\n\n2.

It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.\nBrowser Compatibility\nVue.js supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).\nEcosystem\n\n\n\nProject\nStatus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nvue-router\n\nSingle-page application routing\n\n\nvuex\n\nLarge-scale state management\n\n\nvue-cli\n\nProject scaffolding\n\n\nvue-loader\n\nSingle File Component (*.vue file) loader for webpack\n\n\nvue-server-renderer\n\nServer-side rendering support\n\n\nvue-class-component\n\nTypeScript decorator for a class-based API\n\n\nvue-rx\n\nRxJS integration\n\n\nvue-devtools\n\nBrowser DevTools extension\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nTo check out live examples and docs, visit vuejs.org.\nQuestions\nFor questions and support please use the official forum or community chat.

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\nComponent-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\nLearn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.\n\nLearn how to use React in your own project.\nInstallation\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:\n\nUse Online Playgrounds to get a taste of React.\nAdd React to a Website as a <script> tag in one minute.\nCreate a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\n\nYou can use React as a <script> tag from a CDN, or as a react package on npm.\nDocumentation\nYou can find the React documentation on the website.\nCheck out the Getting Started page for a quick overview.\nThe documentation is divided into several sections:\n\nTutorial\nMain Concepts\nAdvanced Guides\nAPI Reference\nWhere to Get Support\nContributing Guide\n\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository.\nExamples\nWe have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:\nfunction HelloMessage({ name }) {\n  return <div>Hello {name}<\/div>;\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <HelloMessage name=\"Taylor\" \/>,\n  document.getElementById('container')\n);\nThis example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page.\nYou'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a <script> tag, read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript toolchains handle it automatically.\nContributing\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\nCode of Conduct\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\nContributing Guide\nRead our contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.\nGood First Issues\nTo help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.\nLicense\nReact is MIT licensed.\n","3":"\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap\n\n  Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.\n  \nExplore Bootstrap docs \u00bb\n\n\nReport bug\n  \u00b7\n  Request feature\n  \u00b7\n  Themes\n  \u00b7\n  Blog\n\nBootstrap 4\nOur default branch is for development of our upcoming Bootstrap 5 release.

It is also more expressive to mutate your values with statements like num += 1 instead of num++ or num ++. Disallowing unary increment and decrement statements also prevents you from pre-incrementing\/pre-decrementing values unintentionally which can also cause unexpected behavior in your programs.\n\n\/\/ bad\n\nconst array = [1, 2, 3];\nlet num = 1;\nnum++;\n--num;\n\nlet sum = 0;\nlet truthyCount = 0;\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n  let value = array[i];\n  sum += value;\n  if (value) {\n    truthyCount++;\n  }\n}\n\n\/\/ good\n\nconst array = [1, 2, 3];\nlet num = 1;\nnum += 1;\nnum -= 1;\n\nconst sum = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\nconst truthyCount = array.filter(Boolean).length;\n\n\n\n\n\n13.7 Avoid linebreaks before or after = in an assignment.

When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, it uses a set of rules called Automatic Semicolon Insertion to determine whether or not it should regard that line break as the end of a statement, and (as the name implies) place a semicolon into your code before the line break if it thinks so. ASI contains a few eccentric behaviors, though, and your code will break if JavaScript misinterprets your line break. These rules will become more complicated as new features become a part of JavaScript. Explicitly terminating your statements and configuring your linter to catch missing semicolons will help prevent you from encountering issues.\n\n\/\/ bad - raises exception\nconst luke = {}\nconst leia = {}\n[luke, leia].forEach((jedi) => jedi.father = 'vader')\n\n\/\/ bad - raises exception\nconst reaction = \"No!

The parseInt function produces an integer value dictated by interpretation of the contents of the string argument according to the specified radix. Leading whitespace in string is ignored. If radix is undefined or 0, it is assumed to be 10 except when the number begins with the character pairs 0x or 0X, in which case a radix of 16 is assumed. This differs from ECMAScript 3, which merely discouraged (but allowed) octal interpretation. Many implementations have not adopted this behavior as of 2013. And, because older browsers must be supported, always specify a radix.\n\nconst inputValue = '4';\n\n\/\/ bad\nconst val = new Number(inputValue);\n\n\/\/ bad\nconst val = +inputValue;\n\n\/\/ bad\nconst val = inputValue >> 0;\n\n\/\/ bad\nconst val = parseInt(inputValue);\n\n\/\/ good\nconst val = Number(inputValue);\n\n\/\/ good\nconst val = parseInt(inputValue, 10);\n\n\n\n\n\n22.4 If for whatever reason you are doing something wild and parseInt is your bottleneck and need to use Bitshift for performance reasons, leave a comment explaining why and what you\u2019re doing.\n\/\/ good\n\/**\n * parseInt was the reason my code was slow.\n * Bitshifting the String to coerce it to a\n * Number made it a lot faster.\n *\/\nconst val = inputValue >> 0;\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5 Note: Be careful when using bitshift operations.

This convention might lead developers to wrongly think that a change won\u2019t count as breaking, or that tests aren\u2019t needed. tl;dr: if you want something to be \u201cprivate\u201d, it must not be observably present.\n\n\/\/ bad\nthis.__firstName__ = 'Panda';\nthis.firstName_ = 'Panda';\nthis._firstName = 'Panda';\n\n\/\/ good\nthis.firstName = 'Panda';\n\n\/\/ good, in environments where WeakMaps are available\n\/\/ see https:\/\/kangax.github.io\/compat-table\/es6\/#test-WeakMap\nconst firstNames = new WeakMap();\nfirstNames.set(this, 'Panda');\n\n\n\n\n\n23.5 Don\u2019t save references to this.

D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.\nResources\n\nIntroduction\nAPI Reference\nReleases\nExamples\nWiki\n\nInstalling\nIf you use npm, npm install d3. Otherwise, download the latest release. The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from d3js.org, CDNJS, or unpkg. For example:\n<script src=\"https:\/\/d3js.org\/d3.v6.js\"><\/script>\nFor the minified version:\n<script src=\"https:\/\/d3js.org\/d3.v6.min.js\"><\/script>\nYou can also use the standalone D3 microlibraries. For example, d3-selection:\n<script src=\"https:\/\/d3js.org\/d3-selection.v2.js\"><\/script>\nD3 is written using ES2015 modules. Create a custom bundle using Rollup, Webpack, or your preferred bundler. To import D3 into an ES2015 application, either import specific symbols from specific D3 modules:\nimport {scaleLinear} from \"d3-scale\";\nOr import everything into a namespace (here, d3):\nimport * as d3 from \"d3\";\nIn Node:\nconst d3 = require(\"d3\");\nYou can also require individual modules and combine them into a d3 object using Object.assign:\nconst d3 = Object.assign({}, require(\"d3-format\"), require(\"d3-geo\"), require(\"d3-geo-projection\"));\n","6":"\n\n    React Native\n  \n\n\nLearn once, write anywhere:\n  Build mobile apps with React.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n \u00b7 \nLearn the Basics\n \u00b7 \nShowcase\n \u00b7 \nContribute\n \u00b7 \nCommunity\n \u00b7 \nSupport\n\nReact Native brings React's declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.\n\nDeclarative. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.\nComponent-Based. Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.\nDeveloper Velocity. See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.\nPortability. Reuse code across iOS, Android, and other platforms.\n\nReact Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors.

You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like Expo can be used to work around this.\n\ud83c\udf89 Building your first React Native app\nFollow the Getting Started guide. The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:\n\nTrying out React Native\nCreating a New Application\nAdding React Native to an Existing Application\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Documentation\nThe full documentation for React Native can be found on our website.\nThe React Native documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to React Native. For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the React documentation.\nThe source for the React Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, @facebook\/react-native-website.\n\ud83d\ude80 Upgrading\nUpgrading to new versions of React Native may give you access to more APIs, views, developer tools, and other goodies. See the Upgrading Guide for instructions.\nReact Native releases are discussed in the React Native Community, @react-native-community\/react-native-releases.\n\ud83d\udc4f How to Contribute\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React Native core. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bug fixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React Native.\nCode of Conduct\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to.\nPlease read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\nContributing Guide\nRead our Contributing Guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React Native.\nOpen Source Roadmap\nYou can learn more about our vision for React Native in the Roadmap.\nGood First Issues\nWe have a list of good first issues that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started, gain experience, and get familiar with our contribution process.\nDiscussions\nLarger discussions and proposals are discussed in @react-native-community\/discussions-and-proposals.\n\ud83d\udcc4 License\nReact Native is MIT licensed, as found in the LICENSE file.\nReact Native documentation is Creative Commons licensed, as found in the LICENSE-docs file.\n","7":"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures\n\n\nThis repository contains JavaScript based examples of many\npopular algorithms and data structures.\nEach algorithm and data structure has its own separate README\nwith related explanations and links for further reading (including ones\nto YouTube videos).\nRead this in other languages:\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587,\n\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587,\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4,\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e,\nPolski,\nFran\u00e7ais,\nEspa\u00f1ol,\nPortugu\u00eas,\nT\u00fcrk\n\u261d Note that this project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes\nonly and it is not meant to be used for production.\nData Structures\nA data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can\nbe accessed and modified efficiently.

It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.\n\n\nNo Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.\n\n\nNo Lock-In: You can \u201ceject\u201d to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Included?\nYour environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:\n\nReact, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.\nLanguage extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.\nAutoprefixed CSS, so you don\u2019t need -webkit- or other prefixes.\nA fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.\nA live development server that warns about common mistakes.\nA build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.\nAn offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher)\nHassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.\n\nCheck out this guide for an overview of how these tools fit together.\nThe tradeoff is that these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way. If your project needs more customization, you can \"eject\" and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.\nPopular Alternatives\nCreate React App is a great fit for:\n\nLearning React in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.\nStarting new single-page React applications.\nCreating examples with React for your libraries and components.\n\nHere are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:\n\n\nIf you want to try React without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead.\n\n\nIf you need to integrate React code with a server-side template framework like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you\u2019re not building a single-page app, consider using nwb, or Neutrino which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use Rails Webpacker. For Symfony, try Symfony's webpack Encore.\n\n\nIf you need to publish a React component, nwb can also do this, as well as Neutrino's react-components preset.\n\n\nIf you want to do server rendering with React and Node.js, check out Next.js or Razzle. Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and only produces static HTML\/JS\/CSS bundles.\n\n\nIf your website is mostly static (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using Gatsby or Next.js. Unlike Create React App, Gatsby pre-renders the website into HTML at build time. Next.js supports both server rendering and pre-rendering.\n\n\nFinally, if you need more customization, check out Neutrino and its React preset.\n\n\nAll of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.\nIf you prefer configuring the build yourself, follow this guide.\nReact Native\nLooking for something similar, but for React Native?\nCheck out Expo CLI.\nContributing\nWe'd love to have your helping hand on create-react-app!

Here's an example.\n\/\/ Create an instance using the config defaults provided by the library\n\/\/ At this point the timeout config value is `0` as is the default for the library\nconst instance = axios.create();\n\n\/\/ Override timeout default for the library\n\/\/ Now all requests using this instance will wait 2.5 seconds before timing out\ninstance.defaults.timeout = 2500;\n\n\/\/ Override timeout for this request as it's known to take a long time\ninstance.get('\/longRequest', {\n  timeout: 5000\n});\nInterceptors\nYou can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.\n\/\/ Add a request interceptor\naxios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {\n    \/\/ Do something before request is sent\n    return config;\n  }, function (error) {\n    \/\/ Do something with request error\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  });\n\n\/\/ Add a response interceptor\naxios.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {\n    \/\/ Any status code that lie within the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger\n    \/\/ Do something with response data\n    return response;\n  }, function (error) {\n    \/\/ Any status codes that falls outside the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger\n    \/\/ Do something with response error\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  });\nIf you need to remove an interceptor later you can.\nconst myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {\/*...*\/});\naxios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);\nYou can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.\nconst instance = axios.create();\ninstance.interceptors.request.use(function () {\/*...*\/});\nHandling Errors\naxios.get('\/user\/12345')\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    if (error.response) {\n      \/\/ The request was made and the server responded with a status code\n      \/\/ that falls out of the range of 2xx\n      console.log(error.response.data);\n      console.log(error.response.status);\n      console.log(error.response.headers);\n    } else if (error.request) {\n      \/\/ The request was made but no response was received\n      \/\/ `error.request` is an instance of XMLHttpRequest in the browser and an instance of\n      \/\/ http.ClientRequest in node.js\n      console.log(error.request);\n    } else {\n      \/\/ Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error\n      console.log('Error', error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(error.config);\n  });\nUsing the validateStatus config option, you can define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.\naxios.get('\/user\/12345', {\n  validateStatus: function (status) {\n    return status < 500; \/\/ Resolve only if the status code is less than 500\n  }\n})\nUsing toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.\naxios.get('\/user\/12345')\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    console.log(error.toJSON());\n  });\nCancellation\nYou can cancel a request using a cancel token.\n\nThe axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancelable promises proposal.\n\nYou can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:\nconst CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;\nconst source = CancelToken.source();\n\naxios.get('\/user\/12345', {\n  cancelToken: source.token\n}).catch(function (thrown) {\n  if (axios.isCancel(thrown)) {\n    console.log('Request canceled', thrown.message);\n  } else {\n    \/\/ handle error\n  }\n});\n\naxios.post('\/user\/12345', {\n  name: 'new name'\n}, {\n  cancelToken: source.token\n})\n\n\/\/ cancel the request (the message parameter is optional)\nsource.cancel('Operation canceled by the user.');\nYou can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:\nconst CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;\nlet cancel;\n\naxios.get('\/user\/12345', {\n  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function executor(c) {\n    \/\/ An executor function receives a cancel function as a parameter\n    cancel = c;\n  })\n});\n\n\/\/ cancel the request\ncancel();\n\nNote: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token.\n\nUsing application\/x-www-form-urlencoded format\nBy default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application\/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use one of the following options.\nBrowser\nIn a browser, you can use the URLSearchParams API as follows:\nconst params = new URLSearchParams();\nparams.append('param1', 'value1');\nparams.append('param2', 'value2');\naxios.post('\/foo', params);\n\nNote that URLSearchParams is not supported by all browsers (see caniuse.com), but there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).\n\nAlternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:\nconst qs = require('qs');\naxios.post('\/foo', qs.stringify({ 'bar': 123 }));\nOr in another way (ES6),\nimport qs from 'qs';\nconst data = { 'bar': 123 };\nconst options = {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: { 'content-type': 'application\/x-www-form-urlencoded' },\n  data: qs.stringify(data),\n  url,\n};\naxios(options);\nNode.js\nQuery string\nIn node.js, you can use the querystring module as follows:\nconst querystring = require('querystring');\naxios.post('http:\/\/something.com\/', querystring.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }));\nor 'URLSearchParams' from 'url module' as follows:\nconst url = require('url');\nconst params = new url.URLSearchParams({ foo: 'bar' });\naxios.post('http:\/\/something.com\/', params.toString());\nYou can also use the qs library.\nNOTE\nThe qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case (https:\/\/github.com\/nodejs\/node-v0.x-archive\/issues\/1665).\nForm data\nIn node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:\nconst FormData = require('form-data');\n \nconst form = new FormData();\nform.append('my_field', 'my value');\nform.append('my_buffer', new Buffer(10));\nform.append('my_file', fs.createReadStream('\/foo\/bar.jpg'));\n\naxios.post('https:\/\/example.com', form, { headers: form.getHeaders() })\nAlternatively, use an interceptor:\naxios.interceptors.request.use(config => {\n  if (config.data instanceof FormData) {\n    Object.assign(config.headers, config.data.getHeaders());\n  }\n  return config;\n});\nSemver\nUntil axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.\nPromises\naxios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.\nIf your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.\nTypeScript\naxios includes TypeScript definitions.\nimport axios from 'axios';\naxios.get('\/user?ID=12345');\nResources\n\nChangelog\nUpgrade Guide\nEcosystem\nContributing Guide\nCode of Conduct\n\nCredits\naxios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in Angular. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of Angular.\nLicense\nMIT\n","10":"\n\n\n\n\n\nNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment.

Check out the\ninstructions for getting support.\nRelease Types\n\nCurrent: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the\nbranch for its major version number (for example,\nv10.x). Node.js releases a new\nmajor version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in\nApril and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support\nlife of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)\neach October.\nLTS: Releases that receive Long-term Support, with a focus on stability\nand security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.\nLTS releases receive 12 months of Active LTS support and a further 18 months\nof Maintenance. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered codenames,\nbeginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,\nexcept in some special circumstances.\nNightly: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are\nchanges. Use with caution.\n\nCurrent and LTS releases follow Semantic Versioning. A\nmember of the Release Team signs each Current and LTS release.\nFor more information, see the\nRelease README.\nDownload\nBinaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at\nhttps:\/\/nodejs.org\/en\/download\/.\nCurrent and LTS Releases\nhttps:\/\/nodejs.org\/download\/release\/\nThe latest directory is an\nalias for the latest Current release. The latest-codename directory is an\nalias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the\nlatest-carbon directory\ncontains the latest Carbon (Node.js 8) release.\nNightly Releases\nhttps:\/\/nodejs.org\/download\/nightly\/\nEach directory name and filename contains a date (in UTC) and the commit\nSHA at the HEAD of the release.\nAPI Documentation\nDocumentation for the latest Current release is at https:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/.\nVersion-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the\ndocs subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at\nhttps:\/\/nodejs.org\/download\/docs\/.\nVerifying Binaries\nDownload directories contain a SHASUMS256.txt file with SHA checksums for the\nfiles.\nTo download SHASUMS256.txt using curl:\n$ curl -O https:\/\/nodejs.org\/dist\/vx.y.z\/SHASUMS256.txt\nTo check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run\nit through sha256sum with a command such as:\n$ grep node-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c -\nFor Current and LTS, the GPG detached signature of SHASUMS256.txt is in\nSHASUMS256.txt.sig. You can use it with gpg to verify the integrity of\nSHASUM256.txt. You will first need to import\nthe GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases. To\nimport the keys:\n$ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys DD8F2338BAE7501E3DD5AC78C273792F7D83545D\nSee the bottom of this README for a full script to import active release keys.\nNext, download the SHASUMS256.txt.sig for the release:\n$ curl -O https:\/\/nodejs.org\/dist\/vx.y.z\/SHASUMS256.txt.sig\nThen use gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.sig SHASUMS256.txt to verify\nthe file's signature.\nBuilding Node.js\nSee BUILDING.md for instructions on how to build Node.js from\nsource and a list of supported platforms.\nSecurity\nFor information on reporting security vulnerabilities in Node.js, see\nSECURITY.md.\nContributing to Node.js\n\nContributing to the project\nWorking Groups\nStrategic Initiatives\nTechnical values and prioritization\n\nCurrent Project Team Members\nFor information about the governance of the Node.js project, see\nGOVERNANCE.md.\nTSC (Technical Steering Committee)\n\napapirovski -\nAnatoli Papirovski <apapirovski@mac.com> (he\/him)\nBethGriggs -\nBeth Griggs <bgriggs@redhat.com> (she\/her)\nBridgeAR -\nRuben Bridgewater <ruben@bridgewater.de> (he\/him)\nChALkeR -\n\u0421\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 <chalkerx@gmail.com> (he\/him)\ncjihrig -\nColin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com> (he\/him)\ncodebytere -\nShelley Vohr <codebytere@gmail.com> (she\/her)\ndanbev -\nDaniel Bevenius <daniel.bevenius@gmail.com> (he\/him)\nfhinkel -\nFranziska Hinkelmann <franziska.hinkelmann@gmail.com> (she\/her)\ngabrielschulhof -\nGabriel Schulhof <gabriel.schulhof@intel.com>\ngireeshpunathil -\nGireesh Punathil <gpunathi@in.ibm.com> (he\/him)\njasnell -\nJames M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com> (he\/him)\njoyeecheung -\nJoyee Cheung <joyeec9h3@gmail.com> (she\/her)\nmcollina -\nMatteo Collina <matteo.collina@gmail.com> (he\/him)\nmhdawson -\nMichael Dawson <midawson@redhat.com> (he\/him)\nmmarchini -\nMary Marchini <oss@mmarchini.me> (she\/her)\nMylesBorins -\nMyles Borins <myles.borins@gmail.com> (he\/him)\ntargos -\nMicha\u00ebl Zasso <targos@protonmail.com> (he\/him)\ntniessen -\nTobias Nie\u00dfen <tniessen@tnie.de>\nTrott -\nRich Trott <rtrott@gmail.com> (he\/him)\n\nTSC Emeriti\n\naddaleax -\nAnna Henningsen <anna@addaleax.net> (she\/her)\nbnoordhuis -\nBen Noordhuis <info@bnoordhuis.nl>\nchrisdickinson -\nChris Dickinson <christopher.s.dickinson@gmail.com>\nevanlucas -\nEvan Lucas <evanlucas@me.com> (he\/him)\nFishrock123 -\nJeremiah Senkpiel <fishrock123@rocketmail.com> (he\/they)\ngibfahn -\nGibson Fahnestock <gibfahn@gmail.com> (he\/him)\nindutny -\nFedor Indutny <fedor.indutny@gmail.com>\nisaacs -\nIsaac Z.

It lets you\nuse good old HTML (or HAML, Jade\/Pug and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML\u2019s\nsyntax to express your application\u2019s components clearly and succinctly.  It automatically\nsynchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data\nbinding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches\nthe browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.\nIt also helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferred objects,\nand it makes client-side navigation and deep linking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a\npiece of cake. Best of all? It makes development fun!\n\nOn July 1, 2018 AngularJS entered a 3 year Long Term Support period: Find out more\nLooking for the new Angular?

AngularJS is JavaScript MVC made easy\nand done right. (Well it is not really MVC, read on, to understand what this means.)\nMVC, no, MV* done the right way!\nMVC, short for Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern, i.e. how the code should be organized and\nhow the different parts of an application separated for proper readability and debugging. Model is\nthe data and the database. View is the user interface and what the user sees. Controller is the main\nlink between Model and View. These are the three pillars of major programming frameworks present on\nthe market today. On the other hand AngularJS works on MV*, short for Model-View-Whatever. The\nWhatever is AngularJS's way of telling that you may create any kind of linking between the Model\nand the View here.\nUnlike other frameworks in any programming language, where MVC, the three separate components, each\none has to be written and then connected by the programmer, AngularJS helps the programmer by asking\nhim\/her to just create these and everything else will be taken care of by AngularJS.\nInterconnection with HTML at the root level\nAngularJS uses HTML to define the user's interface. AngularJS also enables the programmer to write\nnew HTML tags (AngularJS Directives) and increase the readability and understandability of the HTML\ncode. Directives are AngularJS\u2019s way of bringing additional functionality to HTML. Directives\nachieve this by enabling us to invent our own HTML elements. This also helps in making the code DRY\n(Don't Repeat Yourself), which means once created, a new directive can be used anywhere within the\napplication.\nHTML is also used to determine the wiring of the app. Special attributes in the HTML determine where\nto load the app, which components or controllers to use for each element, etc. We specify \"what\"\ngets loaded, but not \"how\". This declarative approach greatly simplifies app development in a sort\nof WYSIWYG way. Rather than spending time on how the program flows and orchestrating the various\nmoving parts, we simply define what we want and AngularJS will take care of the dependencies.\nData Handling made simple\nData and Data Models in AngularJS are plain JavaScript objects and one can add and change properties\ndirectly on it and loop over objects and arrays at will.\nTwo-way Data Binding\nOne of AngularJS's strongest features. Two-way Data Binding means that if something changes in the\nModel, the change gets reflected in the View instantaneously, and the same happens the other way\naround. This is also referred to as Reactive Programming, i.e. suppose a = b + c is being\nprogrammed and after this, if the value of b and\/or c is changed then the value of a will be\nautomatically updated to reflect the change. AngularJS uses its \"scopes\" as a glue between the Model\nand View and makes these updates in one available for the other.\nLess Written Code and Easily Maintainable Code\nEverything in AngularJS is created to enable the programmer to end up writing less code that is\neasily maintainable and readable by any other new person on the team. Believe it or not, one can\nwrite a complete working two-way data binded application in less than 10 lines of code. Try and see\nfor yourself!\nTesting Ready\nAngularJS has Dependency Injection, i.e. it takes care of providing all the necessary dependencies\nto its controllers and services whenever required. This helps in making the AngularJS code ready for\nunit testing by making use of mock dependencies created and injected. This makes AngularJS more\nmodular and easily testable thus in turn helping a team create more robust applications.\n","16":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nVisit https:\/\/nextjs.org\/learn to get started with Next.js.\nDocumentation\nVisit https:\/\/nextjs.org\/docs to view the full documentation.\nWho is using Next.js?\nNext.js is used by the world's leading companies.

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\nTL;DR\n\nBundles ES Modules, CommonJS, and AMD modules (even combined).\nCan create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\nDependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\nLoaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\nHighly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\nGet Started\nCheck out webpack's quick Get Started guide and the other guides.\nBrowser Compatibility\nwebpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs Promise for import() and require.ensure(). If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a polyfill before using these expressions.\nConcepts\nPlugins\nwebpack has a rich plugin\ninterface.

This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly fast on incremental compilations.\nModule Formats\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules out of the box. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to support most existing libraries out of the box.\nCode Splitting\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\nOptimizations\nwebpack can do many optimizations to reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks cache\nfriendly by using hashes.\nContributing\nWe want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone. We have a vibrant ecosystem that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in our organization or webpack-contrib organization which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\nDocumentation updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\nSpelling or grammar fixes\nREADME.md corrections or redesigns\nAdding unit, or functional tests\nTriaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\nSearching #webpack on twitter and helping someone else who needs help\nTeaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\nBlogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials about one of webpack's many features.\nHelping others in our webpack gitter channel.\n\nTo get started have a look at our documentation on contributing.\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can always reach out to Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\nWe have also started a series on our Medium Publication called The Contributor's Guide to webpack.

We follow the x-loader, x-webpack-plugin naming convention.\nSupport\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isn't always the easiest entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways to improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at our new docs and concepts page. This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old wiki, but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, here is our Gitter room where there are always individuals looking to help out!\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to StackOverflow with the webpack tag. It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\nIf you have discovered a \ud83d\udc1c or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\nLicense\n\nCore Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobias Koppers\nCore\n\nFounder of webpack\n\n\n\n\nJohannes Ewald\nLoaders & Plugins\n\nEarly adopter of webpack\n\n\n\n\nSean T.

Project Structure Practices\n 1.1 Structure your solution by components\nTL;DR: The worst large applications pitfall is maintaining a huge code base with hundreds of dependencies - such a monolith slows down developers as they try to incorporate new features. Instead, partition your code into components, each gets its folder or a dedicated codebase, and ensure that each unit is kept small and simple. Visit 'Read More' below to see examples of correct project structure\nOtherwise: When developers who code new features struggle to realize the impact of their change and fear to break other dependent components - deployments become slower and riskier. It's also considered harder to scale-out when all the business units are not separated\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: structure by components\n\n 1.2 Layer your components, keep the web layer within its boundaries\nTL;DR: Each component should contain 'layers' - a dedicated object for the web, logic, and data access code. This not only draws a clean separation of concerns but also significantly eases mocking and testing the system. Though this is a very common pattern, API developers tend to mix layers by passing the web layer objects (e.g. Express req, res) to business logic and data layers - this makes your application dependent on and accessible only by specific web frameworks\nOtherwise: App that mixes web objects with other layers cannot be accessed by testing code, CRON jobs, triggers from message queues, etc\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: layer your app\n\n 1.3 Wrap common utilities as npm packages\nTL;DR: In a large app that constitutes a large codebase, cross-cutting-concern utilities like a logger, encryption and alike, should be wrapped by your code and exposed as private npm packages. This allows sharing them among multiple codebases and projects\nOtherwise: You'll have to invent your deployment and the dependency wheel\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Structure by feature\n\n 1.4 Separate Express 'app' and 'server'\nTL;DR: Avoid the nasty habit of defining the entire Express app in a single huge file - separate your 'Express' definition to at least two files: the API declaration (app.js) and the networking concerns (WWW). For even better structure, locate your API declaration within components\nOtherwise: Your API will be accessible for testing via HTTP calls only (slower and much harder to generate coverage reports). It probably won't be a big pleasure to maintain hundreds of lines of code in a single file\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: separate Express 'app' and 'server'\n\n 1.5 Use environment aware, secure and hierarchical config\nTL;DR: A perfect and flawless configuration setup should ensure (a) keys can be read from file AND from environment variable (b) secrets are kept outside committed code (c) config is hierarchical for easier findability. There are a few packages that can help tick most of those boxes like rc, nconf, config, and convict.\nOtherwise: Failing to satisfy any of the config requirements will simply bog down the development or DevOps team. Probably both\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: configuration best practices\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\n2. Error Handling Practices\n 2.1 Use Async-Await or promises for async error handling\nTL;DR: Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). The best gift you can give to your code is using a reputable promise library or async-await instead which enables a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch\nOtherwise: Node.js callback style, function(err, response), is a promising way to un-maintainable code due to the mix of error handling with casual code, excessive nesting, and awkward coding patterns\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: avoiding callbacks\n\n 2.2 Use only the built-in Error object\nTL;DR: Many throw errors as a string or as some custom type \u2013 this complicates the error handling logic and the interoperability between modules. Whether you reject a promise, throw an exception or emit an error \u2013 using only the built-in Error object (or an object that extends the built-in Error object) will increase uniformity and prevent loss of information\nOtherwise: When invoking some component, being uncertain which type of errors come in return \u2013 it makes proper error handling much harder. Even worse, using custom types to describe errors might lead to loss of critical error information like the stack trace!\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: using the built-in error object\n\n 2.3 Distinguish operational vs programmer errors\nTL;DR: Operational errors (e.g. API received an invalid input) refer to known cases where the error impact is fully understood and can be handled thoughtfully. On the other hand, programmer error (e.g. trying to read an undefined variable) refers to unknown code failures that dictate to gracefully restart the application\nOtherwise: You may always restart the application when an error appears, but why let ~5000 online users down because of a minor, predicted, operational error? the opposite is also not ideal \u2013 keeping the application up when an unknown issue (programmer error) occurred might lead to an unpredicted behavior. Differentiating the two allows acting tactfully and applying a balanced approach based on the given context\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: operational vs programmer error\n\n 2.4 Handle errors centrally, not within a middleware\nTL;DR: Error handling logic such as mail to admin and logging should be encapsulated in a dedicated and centralized object that all endpoints (e.g. Express middleware, cron jobs, unit-testing) call when an error comes in\nOtherwise: Not handling errors within a single place will lead to code duplication and probably to improperly handled errors\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: handling errors in a centralized place\n\n 2.5 Document API errors using Swagger or GraphQL\nTL;DR: Let your API callers know which errors might come in return so they can handle these thoughtfully without crashing. For RESTful APIs, this is usually done with documentation frameworks like Swagger. If you're using GraphQL, you can utilize your schema and comments as well.\nOtherwise: An API client might decide to crash and restart only because it received back an error it couldn\u2019t understand. Note: the caller of your API might be you (very typical in a microservice environment)\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: documenting API errors in Swagger or GraphQL\n\n 2.6 Exit the process gracefully when a stranger comes to town\nTL;DR: When an unknown error occurs (a developer error, see best practice 2.3) - there is uncertainty about the application healthiness. Common practice suggests restarting the process carefully using a process management tool like Forever or PM2\nOtherwise: When an unfamiliar exception occurs, some object might be in a faulty state (e.g. an event emitter which is used globally and not firing events anymore due to some internal failure) and all future requests might fail or behave crazily\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: shutting the process\n\n 2.7 Use a mature logger to increase error visibility\nTL;DR: A set of mature logging tools like Pino or Log4js, will speed-up error discovery and understanding. So forget about console.log\nOtherwise: Skimming through console.logs or manually through messy text file without querying tools or a decent log viewer might keep you busy at work until late\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: using a mature logger\n\n 2.8 Test error flows using your favorite test framework\nTL;DR: Whether professional automated QA or plain manual developer testing \u2013 Ensure that your code not only satisfies positive scenarios but also handles and returns the right errors. Testing frameworks like Mocha & Chai can handle this easily (see code examples within the \"Gist popup\")\nOtherwise: Without testing, whether automatically or manually, you can\u2019t rely on your code to return the right errors. Without meaningful errors \u2013 there\u2019s no error handling\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: testing error flows\n\n 2.9 Discover errors and downtime using APM products\nTL;DR: Monitoring and performance products (a.k.a APM) proactively gauge your codebase or API so they can automagically highlight errors, crashes, and slow parts that you were missing\nOtherwise: You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you\u2019ll never be aware which are your slowest code parts under real-world scenario and how these affect the UX\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: using APM products\n\n 2.10 Catch unhandled promise rejections\nTL;DR: Any exception thrown within a promise will get swallowed and discarded unless a developer didn\u2019t forget to explicitly handle it. Even if your code is subscribed to process.uncaughtException! Overcome this by registering to the event process.unhandledRejection\nOtherwise: Your errors will get swallowed and leave no trace. Nothing to worry about\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: catching unhandled promise rejection\n\n 2.11 Fail fast, validate arguments using a dedicated library\nTL;DR: Assert API input to avoid nasty bugs that are much harder to track later. The validation code is usually tedious unless you are using a very cool helper library like ajv and Joi\nOtherwise: Consider this \u2013 your function expects a numeric argument \u201cDiscount\u201d which the caller forgets to pass, later on, your code checks if Discount!=0 (amount of allowed discount is greater than zero), then it will allow the user to enjoy a discount. OMG, what a nasty bug. Can you see it?\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: failing fast\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\n3. Code Style Practices\n 3.1 Use ESLint\nTL;DR: ESLint is the de-facto standard for checking possible code errors and fixing code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. Though ESLint can automatically fix code styles, other tools like prettier and beautify are more powerful in formatting the fix and work in conjunction with ESLint\nOtherwise: Developers will focus on tedious spacing and line-width concerns and time might be wasted overthinking the project's code style\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Using ESLint and Prettier\n\n 3.2 Node.js specific plugins\nTL;DR: On top of ESLint standard rules that cover vanilla JavaScript, add Node.js specific plugins like eslint-plugin-node, eslint-plugin-mocha and eslint-plugin-node-security\nOtherwise: Many faulty Node.js code patterns might escape under the radar. For example, developers might require(variableAsPath) files with a variable given as a path which allows attackers to execute any JS script. Node.js linters can detect such patterns and complain early\n\n 3.3 Start a Codeblock's Curly Braces on the Same Line\nTL;DR: The opening curly braces of a code block should be on the same line as the opening statement\nCode Example\n\/\/ Do\nfunction someFunction() {\n  \/\/ code block\n}\n\n\/\/ Avoid\nfunction someFunction()\n{\n  \/\/ code block\n}\nOtherwise: Deferring from this best practice might lead to unexpected results, as seen in the StackOverflow thread below:\n\ud83d\udd17 Read more: \"Why do results vary based on curly brace placement?\" (StackOverflow)\n\n 3.4 Separate your statements properly\nNo matter if you use semicolons or not to separate your statements, knowing the common pitfalls of improper linebreaks or automatic semicolon insertion, will help you to eliminate regular syntax errors.\nTL;DR: Use ESLint to gain awareness about separation concerns. Prettier or Standardjs can automatically resolve these issues.\nOtherwise: As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpreter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one, or considers a statement as not ended where it should, which might lead to some undesired results. You can use assignments and avoid using immediately invoked function expressions to prevent most of the unexpected errors.\nCode example\n\/\/ Do\nfunction doThing() {\n    \/\/ ...\n}\n\ndoThing()\n\n\/\/ Do\n\nconst items = [1, 2, 3]\nitems.forEach(console.log)\n\n\/\/ Avoid \u2014 throws exception\nconst m = new Map()\nconst a = [1,2,3]\n[...m.values()].forEach(console.log)\n> [...m.values()].forEach(console.log)\n>  ^^^\n> SyntaxError: Unexpected token ...\n\n\/\/ Avoid \u2014 throws exception\nconst count = 2 \/\/ it tries to run 2(), but 2 is not a function\n(function doSomething() {\n  \/\/ do something amazing\n}())\n\/\/ put a semicolon before the immediate invoked function, after the const definition, save the return value of the anonymous function to a variable or avoid IIFEs alltogether\n\ud83d\udd17 Read more: \"Semi ESLint rule\"\n\ud83d\udd17 Read more: \"No unexpected multiline ESLint rule\"\n\n 3.5 Name your functions\nTL;DR: Name all functions, including closures and callbacks. Avoid anonymous functions. This is especially useful when profiling a node app. Naming all functions will allow you to easily understand what you're looking at when checking a memory snapshot\nOtherwise: Debugging production issues using a core dump (memory snapshot) might become challenging as you notice significant memory consumption from anonymous functions\n\n 3.6 Use naming conventions for variables, constants, functions and classes\nTL;DR: Use lowerCamelCase when naming constants, variables and functions and UpperCamelCase (capital first letter as well) when naming classes. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables\/functions, and classes that require instantiation. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short\nOtherwise: Javascript is the only language in the world that allows invoking a constructor (\"Class\") directly without instantiating it first. Consequently, Classes and function-constructors are differentiated by starting with UpperCamelCase\n3.6 Code Example\n\/\/ for class name we use UpperCamelCase\nclass SomeClassExample {}\n\n\/\/ for const names we use the const keyword and lowerCamelCase\nconst config = {\n  key: \"value\"\n};\n\n\/\/ for variables and functions names we use lowerCamelCase\nlet someVariableExample = \"value\";\nfunction doSomething() {}\n\n 3.7 Prefer const over let. Ditch the var\nTL;DR: Using const means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Preferring const will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop, for example, use let to declare it. Another important aspect of let is that a variable declared using it is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. var is function scoped, not block-scoped, and shouldn't be used in ES6 now that you have const and let at your disposal\nOtherwise: Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes\n\ud83d\udd17 Read more: JavaScript ES6+: var, let, or const? \n\n 3.8 Require modules first, not inside functions\nTL;DR: Require modules at the beginning of each file, before and outside of any functions. This simple best practice will not only help you easily and quickly tell the dependencies of a file right at the top but also avoids a couple of potential problems\nOtherwise: Requires are run synchronously by Node.js. If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being handled at a more critical time. Also, if a required module or any of its dependencies throw an error and crash the server, it is best to find out about it as soon as possible, which might not be the case if that module is required from within a function\n\n 3.9 Require modules by folders, as opposed to the files directly\nTL;DR: When developing a module\/library in a folder, place an index.js file that exposes the module's internals so every consumer will pass through it. This serves as an 'interface' to your module and eases future changes without breaking the contract\nOtherwise: Changing the internal structure of files or the signature may break the interface with clients\n3.9 Code example\n\/\/ Do\nmodule.exports.SMSProvider = require(\".\/SMSProvider\");\nmodule.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require(\".\/SMSNumberResolver\");\n\n\/\/ Avoid\nmodule.exports.SMSProvider = require(\".\/SMSProvider\/SMSProvider.js\");\nmodule.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require(\".\/SMSNumberResolver\/SMSNumberResolver.js\");\n\n 3.10 Use the === operator\nTL;DR: Prefer the strict equality operator === over the weaker abstract equality operator ==. == will compare two variables after converting them to a common type. There is no type conversion in ===, and both variables must be of the same type to be equal\nOtherwise: Unequal variables might return true when compared with the == operator\n3.10 Code example\n\"\" == \"0\"; \/\/ false\n0 == \"\"; \/\/ true\n0 == \"0\"; \/\/ true\n\nfalse == \"false\"; \/\/ false\nfalse == \"0\"; \/\/ true\n\nfalse == undefined; \/\/ false\nfalse == null; \/\/ false\nnull == undefined; \/\/ true\n\n\" \\t\\r\\n \" == 0; \/\/ true\nAll statements above will return false if used with ===\n\n 3.11 Use Async Await, avoid callbacks\nTL;DR: Node 8 LTS now has full support for Async-await. This is a new way of dealing with asynchronous code which supersedes callbacks and promises. Async-await is non-blocking, and it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. The best gift you can give to your code is using async-await which provides a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch\nOtherwise: Handling async errors in callback style are probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with awkward code nesting, and makes it difficult to reason about the code flow\n\ud83d\udd17Read more: Guide to async-await 1.0\n\n 3.12 Use arrow function expressions (=>)\nTL;DR: Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters when dealing with older APIs that accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code structure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. this)\nOtherwise: Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read\n\ud83d\udd17 Read more: It\u2019s Time to Embrace Arrow Functions\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\n4. Testing And Overall Quality Practices\n 4.1 At the very least, write API (component) testing\nTL;DR: Most projects just don't have any automated testing due to short timetables or often the 'testing project' ran out of control and was abandoned. For that reason, prioritize and start with API testing which is the easiest way to write and provides more coverage than unit testing (you may even craft API tests without code using tools like Postman. Afterward, should you have more resources and time, continue with advanced test types like unit testing, DB testing, performance testing, etc\nOtherwise: You may spend long days on writing unit tests to find out that you got only 20% system coverage\n\n 4.2 Include 3 parts in each test name\nTL;DR: Make the test speak at the requirements level so it's self-explanatory also to QA engineers and developers who are not familiar with the code internals. State in the test name what is being tested (unit under test), under what circumstances, and what is the expected result\nOtherwise: A deployment just failed, a test named \u201cAdd product\u201d failed. Does this tell you what exactly is malfunctioning?\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Include 3 parts in each test name\n\n 4.3 Structure tests by the AAA pattern\nTL;DR: Structure your tests with 3 well-separated sections: Arrange, Act & Assert (AAA). The first part includes the test setup, then the execution of the unit under test, and finally the assertion phase. Following this structure guarantees that the reader spends no brain CPU on understanding the test plan\nOtherwise: Not only you spend long daily hours on understanding the main code, but now also what should have been the simple part of the day (testing) stretches your brain\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Structure tests by the AAA pattern\n\n 4.4 Detect code issues with a linter\nTL;DR: Use a code linter to check the basic quality and detect anti-patterns early. Run it before any test and add it as a pre-commit git-hook to minimize the time needed to review and correct any issue. Also check Section 3 on Code Style Practices\nOtherwise: You may let pass some anti-pattern and possible vulnerable code to your production environment.\n\n 4.5 Avoid global test fixtures and seeds, add data per-test\nTL;DR: To prevent test coupling and easily reason about the test flow, each test should add and act on its own set of DB rows. Whenever a test needs to pull or assume the existence of some DB data - it must explicitly add that data and avoid mutating any other records\nOtherwise: Consider a scenario where deployment is aborted due to failing tests, team is now going to spend precious investigation time that ends in a sad conclusion: the system works well, the tests however interfere with each other and break the build\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Avoid global test fixtures\n\n 4.6 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies\nTL;DR: Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community and commercial tools such as \ud83d\udd17 npm audit and \ud83d\udd17 snyk.io that can be invoked from your CI on every build\nOtherwise: Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious\n\n 4.7 Tag your tests\nTL;DR: Different tests must run on different scenarios: quick smoke, IO-less, tests should run when a developer saves or commits a file, full end-to-end tests usually run when a new pull request is submitted, etc. This can be achieved by tagging tests with keywords like #cold #api #sanity so you can grep with your testing harness and invoke the desired subset. For example, this is how you would invoke only the sanity test group with Mocha: mocha --grep 'sanity'\nOtherwise: Running all the tests, including tests that perform dozens of DB queries, any time a developer makes a small change can be extremely slow and keeps developers away from running tests\n\n 4.8 Check your test coverage, it helps to identify wrong test patterns\nTL;DR: Code coverage tools like Istanbul\/NYC are great for 3 reasons: it comes for free (no effort is required to benefit this reports), it helps to identify a decrease in testing coverage, and last but not least it highlights testing mismatches: by looking at colored code coverage reports you may notice, for example, code areas that are never tested like catch clauses (meaning that tests only invoke the happy paths and not how the app behaves on errors). Set it to fail builds if the coverage falls under a certain threshold\nOtherwise: There won't be any automated metric telling you when a large portion of your code is not covered by testing\n\n 4.9 Inspect for outdated packages\nTL;DR: Use your preferred tool (e.g. 'npm outdated' or npm-check-updates to detect installed outdated packages, inject this check into your CI pipeline and even make a build fail in a severe scenario. For example, a severe scenario might be when an installed package is 5 patch commits behind (e.g. local version is 1.3.1 and repository version is 1.3.8) or it is tagged as deprecated by its author - kill the build and prevent deploying this version\nOtherwise: Your production will run packages that have been explicitly tagged by their author as risky\n\n 4.10 Use production-like environment for e2e testing\nTL;DR: End to end (e2e) testing which includes live data used to be the weakest link of the CI process as it depends on multiple heavy services like DB. Use an environment which is as close to your real production environment as possible like a-continue (Missed -continue here, needs content. Judging by the Otherwise clause, this should mention docker-compose)\nOtherwise: Without docker-compose, teams must maintain a testing DB for each testing environment including developers' machines, keep all those DBs in sync so test results won't vary across environments\n\n 4.11 Refactor regularly using static analysis tools\nTL;DR: Using static analysis tools helps by giving objective ways to improve code quality and keeps your code maintainable. You can add static analysis tools to your CI build to fail when it finds code smells. Its main selling points over plain linting are the ability to inspect quality in the context of multiple files (e.g. detect duplications), perform advanced analysis (e.g. code complexity), and follow the history and progress of code issues. Two examples of tools you can use are Sonarqube (2,600+ stars) and Code Climate (1,500+ stars).\nOtherwise: With poor code quality, bugs and performance will always be an issue that no shiny new library or state of the art features can fix\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Refactoring!\n\n 4.12 Carefully choose your CI platform (Jenkins vs CircleCI vs Travis vs Rest of the world)\nTL;DR: Your continuous integration platform (CICD) will host all the quality tools (e.g test, lint) so it should come with a vibrant ecosystem of plugins. Jenkins used to be the default for many projects as it has the biggest community along with a very powerful platform at the price of a complex setup that demands a steep learning curve. Nowadays, it has become much easier to set up a CI solution using SaaS tools like CircleCI and others. These tools allow crafting a flexible CI pipeline without the burden of managing the whole infrastructure. Eventually, it's a trade-off between robustness and speed - choose your side carefully\nOtherwise: Choosing some niche vendor might get you blocked once you need some advanced customization. On the other hand, going with Jenkins might burn precious time on infrastructure setup\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Choosing CI platform\n 4.13 Test your middlewares in isolation\nTL;DR: When a middleware holds some immense logic that spans many requests, it worth testing it in isolation without waking up the entire web framework. This can be easily achieved by stubbing and spying on the {req, res, next} objects\nOtherwise: A bug in Express middleware === a bug in all or most requests\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Test middlewares in isolation\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\n5. Going To Production Practices\n 5.1. Monitoring\nTL;DR: Monitoring is a game of finding out issues before customers do \u2013 obviously this should be assigned unprecedented importance. The market is overwhelmed with offers thus consider starting with defining the basic metrics you must follow (my suggestions inside), then go over additional fancy features and choose the solution that ticks all boxes. Click \u2018The Gist\u2019 below for an overview of the solutions\nOtherwise: Failure === disappointed customers. Simple\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Monitoring!\n\n 5.2. Increase transparency using smart logging\nTL;DR: Logs can be a dumb warehouse of debug statements or the enabler of a beautiful dashboard that tells the story of your app. Plan your logging platform from day 1: how logs are collected, stored and analyzed to ensure that the desired information (e.g. error rate, following an entire transaction through services and servers, etc) can really be extracted\nOtherwise: You end up with a black box that is hard to reason about, then you start re-writing all logging statements to add additional information\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Increase transparency using smart logging\n\n 5.3. Delegate anything possible (e.g. gzip, SSL) to a reverse proxy\nTL;DR: Node is awfully bad at doing CPU intensive tasks like gzipping, SSL termination, etc. You should use \u2018real\u2019 middleware services like nginx, HAproxy or cloud vendor services instead\nOtherwise: Your poor single thread will stay busy doing infrastructural tasks instead of dealing with your application core and performance will degrade accordingly\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Delegate anything possible (e.g. gzip, SSL) to a reverse proxy\n\n 5.4. Lock dependencies\nTL;DR: Your code must be identical across all environments, but amazingly npm lets dependencies drift across environments by default \u2013 when you install packages at various environments it tries to fetch packages\u2019 latest patch version. Overcome this by using npm config files, .npmrc, that tell each environment to save the exact (not the latest) version of each package. Alternatively, for finer grained control use npm shrinkwrap. *Update: as of NPM5, dependencies are locked by default. The new package manager in town, Yarn, also got us covered by default\nOtherwise: QA will thoroughly test the code and approve a version that will behave differently in production. Even worse, different servers in the same production cluster might run different code\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Lock dependencies\n\n 5.5. Guard process uptime using the right tool\nTL;DR: The process must go on and get restarted upon failures. For simple scenarios, process management tools like PM2 might be enough but in today's \u2018dockerized\u2019 world, cluster management tools should be considered as well\nOtherwise: Running dozens of instances without a clear strategy and too many tools together (cluster management, docker, PM2) might lead to DevOps chaos\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Guard process uptime using the right tool\n\n 5.6. Utilize all CPU cores\nTL;DR: At its basic form, a Node app runs on a single CPU core while all others are left idling. It\u2019s your duty to replicate the Node process and utilize all CPUs \u2013 For small-medium apps you may use Node Cluster or PM2. For a larger app consider replicating the process using some Docker cluster (e.g. K8S, ECS) or deployment scripts that are based on Linux init system (e.g. systemd)\nOtherwise: Your app will likely utilize only 25% of its available resources(!) or even less. Note that a typical server has 4 CPU cores or more, naive deployment of Node.js utilizes only 1 (even using PaaS services like AWS beanstalk!)\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Utilize all CPU cores\n\n 5.7. Create a \u2018maintenance endpoint\u2019\nTL;DR: Expose a set of system-related information, like memory usage and REPL, etc in a secured API. Although it\u2019s highly recommended to rely on standard and battle-tests tools, some valuable information and operations are easier done using code\nOtherwise: You\u2019ll find that you\u2019re performing many \u201cdiagnostic deploys\u201d \u2013 shipping code to production only to extract some information for diagnostic purposes\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Create a \u2018maintenance endpoint\u2019\n\n 5.8. Discover errors and downtime using APM products\nTL;DR: Application monitoring and performance products (a.k.a APM) proactively gauge codebase and API so they can auto-magically go beyond traditional monitoring and measure the overall user-experience across services and tiers. For example, some APM products can highlight a transaction that loads too slow on the end-users side while suggesting the root cause\nOtherwise: You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you\u2019ll never be aware which is your slowest code parts under real-world scenario and how these affect the UX\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Discover errors and downtime using APM products\n\n 5.9. Make your code production-ready\nTL;DR: Code with the end in mind, plan for production from day 1. This sounds a bit vague so I\u2019ve compiled a few development tips that are closely related to production maintenance (click Gist below)\nOtherwise: A world champion IT\/DevOps guy won\u2019t save a system that is badly written\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Make your code production-ready\n\n 5.10. Measure and guard the memory usage\nTL;DR: Node.js has controversial relationships with memory: the v8 engine has soft limits on memory usage (1.4GB) and there are known paths to leak memory in Node\u2019s code \u2013 thus watching Node\u2019s process memory is a must. In small apps, you may gauge memory periodically using shell commands but in medium-large apps consider baking your memory watch into a robust monitoring system\nOtherwise: Your process memory might leak a hundred megabytes a day like how it happened at Walmart\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Measure and guard the memory usage\n\n 5.11. Get your frontend assets out of Node\nTL;DR: Serve frontend content using dedicated middleware (nginx, S3, CDN) because Node performance really gets hurt when dealing with many static files due to its single-threaded model\nOtherwise: Your single Node thread will be busy streaming hundreds of html\/images\/angular\/react files instead of allocating all its resources for the task it was born for \u2013 serving dynamic content\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Get your frontend assets out of Node\n\n 5.12. Be stateless, kill your servers almost every day\nTL;DR: Store any type of data (e.g. user sessions, cache, uploaded files) within external data stores. Consider \u2018killing\u2019 your servers periodically or use \u2018serverless\u2019 platform (e.g. AWS Lambda) that explicitly enforces a stateless behavior\nOtherwise: Failure at a given server will result in application downtime instead of just killing a faulty machine. Moreover, scaling-out elasticity will get more challenging due to the reliance on a specific server\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Be stateless, kill your Servers almost every day\n\n 5.13. Use tools that automatically detect vulnerabilities\nTL;DR: Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities (from time to time) that can put a system at risk. This can be easily tamed using community and commercial tools that constantly check for vulnerabilities and warn (locally or at GitHub), some can even patch them immediately\nOtherwise: Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require you to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Use tools that automatically detect vulnerabilities\n\n 5.14. Assign a transaction id to each log statement\nTL;DR: Assign the same identifier, transaction-id: {some value}, to each log entry within a single request. Then when inspecting errors in logs, easily conclude what happened before and after. Unfortunately, this is not easy to achieve in Node due to its async nature, see code examples inside\nOtherwise: Looking at a production error log without the context \u2013 what happened before \u2013 makes it much harder and slower to reason about the issue\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Assign \u2018TransactionId\u2019 to each log statement\n\n 5.15. Set NODE_ENV=production\nTL;DR: Set the environment variable NODE_ENV to \u2018production\u2019 or \u2018development\u2019 to flag whether production optimizations should get activated \u2013 many npm packages determine the current environment and optimize their code for production\nOtherwise: Omitting this simple property might greatly degrade performance. For example, when using Express for server-side rendering omitting NODE_ENV makes it slower by a factor of three!\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Set NODE_ENV=production\n\n 5.16. Design automated, atomic and zero-downtime deployments\nTL;DR: Research shows that teams who perform many deployments lower the probability of severe production issues. Fast and automated deployments that don\u2019t require risky manual steps and service downtime significantly improve the deployment process. You should probably achieve this using Docker combined with CI tools as they became the industry standard for streamlined deployment\nOtherwise: Long deployments -> production downtime & human-related error -> team unconfident in making deployment -> fewer deployments and features\n\n 5.17. Use an LTS release of Node.js\nTL;DR: Ensure you are using an LTS version of Node.js to receive critical bug fixes, security updates and performance improvements\nOtherwise: Newly discovered bugs or vulnerabilities could be used to exploit an application running in production, and your application may become unsupported by various modules and harder to maintain\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Use an LTS release of Node.js\n\n 5.18. Don't route logs within the app\nTL;DR: Log destinations should not be hard-coded by developers within the application code, but instead should be defined by the execution environment the application runs in. Developers should write logs to stdout using a logger utility and then let the execution environment (container, server, etc.) pipe the stdout stream to the appropriate destination (i.e. Splunk, Graylog, ElasticSearch, etc.).\nOtherwise: Application handling log routing === hard to scale, loss of logs, poor separation of concerns\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Log Routing\n\n 5.19. Install your packages with npm ci\nTL;DR: You have to be sure that production code uses the exact version of the packages you have tested it with. Run npm ci to strictly do a clean install of your dependencies matching package.json and package-lock.json. Using this command is recommended in automated environments such as continuous integration pipelines.\nOtherwise: QA will thoroughly test the code and approve a version that will behave differently in production. Even worse, different servers in the same production cluster might run different code.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Use npm ci\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\n6. Security Best Practices\n\n\n\n 6.1. Embrace linter security rules\n \nTL;DR: Make use of security-related linter plugins such as eslint-plugin-security to catch security vulnerabilities and issues as early as possible, preferably while they're being coded. This can help catching security weaknesses like using eval, invoking a child process or importing a module with a string literal (e.g. user input). Click 'Read more' below to see code examples that will get caught by a security linter\nOtherwise: What could have been a straightforward security weakness during development becomes a major issue in production. Also, the project may not follow consistent code security practices, leading to vulnerabilities being introduced, or sensitive secrets committed into remote repositories\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Lint rules\n\n 6.2. Limit concurrent requests using a middleware\n\nTL;DR: DOS attacks are very popular and relatively easy to conduct. Implement rate limiting using an external service such as cloud load balancers, cloud firewalls, nginx, rate-limiter-flexible package, or (for smaller and less critical apps) a rate-limiting middleware (e.g. express-rate-limit)\nOtherwise: An application could be subject to an attack resulting in a denial of service where real users receive a degraded or unavailable service.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Implement rate limiting\n\n 6.3 Extract secrets from config files or use packages to encrypt them\n \nTL;DR: Never store plain-text secrets in configuration files or source code. Instead, make use of secret-management systems like Vault products, Kubernetes\/Docker Secrets, or using environment variables. As a last resort, secrets stored in source control must be encrypted and managed (rolling keys, expiring, auditing, etc). Make use of pre-commit\/push hooks to prevent committing secrets accidentally\nOtherwise: Source control, even for private repositories, can mistakenly be made public, at which point all secrets are exposed. Access to source control for an external party will inadvertently provide access to related systems (databases, apis, services, etc).\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Secret management\n\n 6.4. Prevent query injection vulnerabilities with ORM\/ODM libraries\n\nTL;DR: To prevent SQL\/NoSQL injection and other malicious attacks, always make use of an ORM\/ODM or a database library that escapes data or supports named or indexed parameterized queries, and takes care of validating user input for expected types. Never just use JavaScript template strings or string concatenation to inject values into queries as this opens your application to a wide spectrum of vulnerabilities. All the reputable Node.js data access libraries (e.g. Sequelize, Knex, mongoose) have built-in protection against injection attacks.\nOtherwise: Unvalidated or unsanitized user input could lead to operator injection when working with MongoDB for NoSQL, and not using a proper sanitization system or ORM will easily allow SQL injection attacks, creating a giant vulnerability.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Query injection prevention using ORM\/ODM libraries\n\n 6.5. Collection of generic security best practices\nTL;DR: This is a collection of security advice that is not related directly to Node.js - the Node implementation is not much different than any other language. Click read more to skim through.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Common security best practices\n\n 6.6. Adjust the HTTP response headers for enhanced security\n\nTL;DR: Your application should be using secure headers to prevent attackers from using common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other malicious attacks. These can be configured easily using modules like helmet.\nOtherwise: Attackers could perform direct attacks on your application's users, leading to huge security vulnerabilities\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Using secure headers in your application\n\n 6.7. Constantly and automatically inspect for vulnerable dependencies\n\nTL;DR: With the npm ecosystem it is common to have many dependencies for a project. Dependencies should always be kept in check as new vulnerabilities are found. Use tools like npm audit or snyk to track, monitor and patch vulnerable dependencies. Integrate these tools with your CI setup so you catch a vulnerable dependency before it makes it to production.\nOtherwise: An attacker could detect your web framework and attack all its known vulnerabilities.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Dependency security\n\n 6.8. Protect Users' Passwords\/Secrets using BCrypt or Script\n\nTL;DR: Passwords or secrets (e.g. API keys) should be stored using a secure hash + salt function like bcrypt,scrypt, or worst case pbkdf2.\nOtherwise: Passwords and secrets that are stored without using a secure function are vulnerable to brute forcing and dictionary attacks that will lead to their disclosure eventually.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: User Passwords\n\n 6.9. Escape HTML, JS and CSS output\n\nTL;DR: Untrusted data that is sent down to the browser might get executed instead of just being displayed, this is commonly referred as a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack. Mitigate this by using dedicated libraries that explicitly mark the data as pure content that should never get executed (i.e. encoding, escaping)\nOtherwise: An attacker might store malicious JavaScript code in your DB which will then be sent as-is to the poor clients\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Escape output\n\n 6.10. Validate incoming JSON schemas\n \nTL;DR: Validate the incoming requests' body payload and ensure it meets expectations, fail fast if it doesn't. To avoid tedious validation coding within each route you may use lightweight JSON-based validation schemas such as jsonschema or joi\nOtherwise: Your generosity and permissive approach greatly increases the attack surface and encourages the attacker to try out many inputs until they find some combination to crash the application\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Validate incoming JSON schemas\n\n 6.11. Support blacklisting JWTs\n\nTL;DR: When using JSON Web Tokens (for example, with Passport.js), by default there's no mechanism to revoke access from issued tokens. Once you discover some malicious user activity, there's no way to stop them from accessing the system as long as they hold a valid token. Mitigate this by implementing a blacklist of untrusted tokens that are validated on each request.\nOtherwise: Expired, or misplaced tokens could be used maliciously by a third party to access an application and impersonate the owner of the token.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Blacklist JSON Web Tokens\n\n 6.12. Prevent brute-force attacks against authorization\n\nTL;DR: A simple and powerful technique is to limit authorization attempts using two metrics:\n\nThe first is number of consecutive failed attempts by the same user unique ID\/name and IP address.\nThe second is number of failed attempts from an IP address over some long period of time. For example, block an IP address if it makes 100 failed attempts in one day.\n\nOtherwise: An attacker can issue unlimited automated password attempts to gain access to privileged accounts on an application\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Login rate limiting\n\n 6.13. Run Node.js as non-root user\n\nTL;DR: There is a common scenario where Node.js runs as a root user with unlimited permissions. For example, this is the default behaviour in Docker containers. It's recommended to create a non-root user and either bake it into the Docker image (examples given below) or run the process on this user's behalf by invoking the container with the flag \"-u username\"\nOtherwise: An attacker who manages to run a script on the server gets unlimited power over the local machine (e.g. change iptable and re-route traffic to his server)\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Run Node.js as non-root user\n\n 6.14. Limit payload size using a reverse-proxy or a middleware\n \nTL;DR: The bigger the body payload is, the harder your single thread works in processing it. This is an opportunity for attackers to bring servers to their knees without tremendous amount of requests (DOS\/DDOS attacks). Mitigate this limiting the body size of incoming requests on the edge (e.g. firewall, ELB) or by configuring express body parser to accept only small-size payloads\nOtherwise: Your application will have to deal with large requests, unable to process the other important work it has to accomplish, leading to performance implications and vulnerability towards DOS attacks\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Limit payload size\n\n 6.15. Avoid JavaScript eval statements\n  \nTL;DR: eval is evil as it allows executing custom JavaScript code during run time. This is not just a performance concern but also an important security concern due to malicious JavaScript code that may be sourced from user input. Another language feature that should be avoided is new Function constructor. setTimeout and setInterval should never be passed dynamic JavaScript code either.\nOtherwise: Malicious JavaScript code finds a way into text passed into eval or other real-time evaluating JavaScript language functions, and will gain complete access to JavaScript permissions on the page. This vulnerability is often manifested as an XSS attack.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Avoid JavaScript eval statements\n\n 6.16. Prevent evil RegEx from overloading your single thread execution\n\nTL;DR: Regular Expressions, while being handy, pose a real threat to JavaScript applications at large, and the Node.js platform in particular. A user input for text to match might require an outstanding amount of CPU cycles to process. RegEx processing might be inefficient to an extent that a single request that validates 10 words can block the entire event loop for 6 seconds and set the CPU on \ud83d\udd25. For that reason, prefer third-party validation packages like validator.js instead of writing your own Regex patterns, or make use of safe-regex to detect vulnerable regex patterns\nOtherwise: Poorly written regexes could be susceptible to Regular Expression DoS attacks that will block the event loop completely. For example, the popular moment package was found vulnerable with malicious RegEx usage in November of 2017\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Prevent malicious RegEx\n\n 6.17. Avoid module loading using a variable\n  \nTL;DR: Avoid requiring\/importing another file with a path that was given as parameter due to the concern that it could have originated from user input. This rule can be extended for accessing files in general (i.e. fs.readFile()) or other sensitive resource access with dynamic variables originating from user input. Eslint-plugin-security linter can catch such patterns and warn early enough\nOtherwise: Malicious user input could find its way to a parameter that is used to require tampered files, for example, a previously uploaded file on the file system, or access already existing system files.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Safe module loading\n\n 6.18. Run unsafe code in a sandbox\n  \nTL;DR: When tasked to run external code that is given at run-time (e.g. plugin), use any sort of 'sandbox' execution environment that isolates and guards the main code against the plugin. This can be achieved using a dedicated process (e.g. cluster.fork()), serverless environment or dedicated npm packages that act as a sandbox\nOtherwise: A plugin can attack through an endless variety of options like infinite loops, memory overloading, and access to sensitive process environment variables\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Run unsafe code in a sandbox\n\n 6.19. Take extra care when working with child processes\n  \nTL;DR: Avoid using child processes when possible and validate and sanitize input to mitigate shell injection attacks if you still have to. Prefer using child_process.execFile which by definition will only execute a single command with a set of attributes and will not allow shell parameter expansion.\nOtherwise: Naive use of child processes could result in remote command execution or shell injection attacks due to malicious user input passed to an unsanitized system command.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Be cautious when working with child processes\n\n 6.20. Hide error details from clients\n\nTL;DR: An integrated express error handler hides the error details by default. However, great are the chances that you implement your own error handling logic with custom Error objects (considered by many as a best practice). If you do so, ensure not to return the entire Error object to the client, which might contain some sensitive application details\nOtherwise: Sensitive application details such as server file paths, third party modules in use, and other internal workflows of the application which could be exploited by an attacker, could be leaked from information found in a stack trace\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Hide error details from client\n\n 6.21. Configure 2FA for npm or Yarn\n\nTL;DR: Any step in the development chain should be protected with MFA (multi-factor authentication), npm\/Yarn are a sweet opportunity for attackers who can get their hands on some developer's password. Using developer credentials, attackers can inject malicious code into libraries that are widely installed across projects and services. Maybe even across the web if published in public. Enabling 2-factor-authentication in npm leaves almost zero chances for attackers to alter your package code.\nOtherwise: Have you heard about the eslint developer whose password was hijacked?\n\n 6.22. Modify session middleware settings\n\nTL;DR: Each web framework and technology has its known weaknesses\u200a-\u200atelling an attacker which web framework we use is a great help for them. Using the default settings for session middlewares can expose your app to module- and framework-specific hijacking attacks in a similar way to the X-Powered-By header. Try hiding anything that identifies and reveals your tech stack (E.g. Node.js, express)\nOtherwise: Cookies could be sent over insecure connections, and an attacker might use session identification to identify the underlying framework of the web application, as well as module-specific vulnerabilities\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Cookie and session security\n\n 6.23. Avoid DOS attacks by explicitly setting when a process should crash\n\nTL;DR: The Node process will crash when errors are not handled. Many best practices even recommend to exit even though an error was caught and got handled. Express, for example, will crash on any asynchronous error\u200a-\u200aunless you wrap routes with a catch clause. This opens a very sweet attack spot for attackers who recognize what input makes the process crash and repeatedly send the same request. There's no instant remedy for this but a few techniques can mitigate the pain: Alert with critical severity anytime a process crashes due to an unhandled error, validate the input and avoid crashing the process due to invalid user input, wrap all routes with a catch and consider not to crash when an error originated within a request (as opposed to what happens globally)\nOtherwise: This is just an educated guess: given many Node.js applications, if we try passing an empty JSON body to all POST requests\u200a-\u200aa handful of applications will crash. At that point, we can just repeat sending the same request to take down the applications with ease\n\n 6.24. Prevent unsafe redirects\n\nTL;DR: Redirects that do not validate user input can enable attackers to launch phishing scams, steal user credentials, and perform other malicious actions.\nOtherwise: If an attacker discovers that you are not validating external, user-supplied input, they may exploit this vulnerability by posting specially-crafted links on forums, social media, and other public places to get users to click it.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Prevent unsafe redirects\n\n 6.25. Avoid publishing secrets to the npm registry\n\nTL;DR: Precautions should be taken to avoid the risk of accidentally publishing secrets to public npm registries. An .npmignore file can be used to blacklist specific files or folders, or the files array in package.json can act as a whitelist.\nOtherwise: Your project's API keys, passwords or other secrets are open to be abused by anyone who comes across them, which may result in financial loss, impersonation, and other risks.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Avoid publishing secrets\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\n7. Draft: Performance Best Practices\nOur contributors are working on this section. Would you like to join?\n\n 7.1. Don't block the event loop\nTL;DR: Avoid CPU intensive tasks as they will block the mostly single-threaded Event Loop and offload those to a dedicated thread, process or even a different technology based on the context.\nOtherwise: As the Event Loop is blocked, Node.js will be unable to handle other request thus causing delays for concurrent users. 3000 users are waiting for a response, the content is ready to be served, but one single request blocks the server from dispatching the results back\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Do not block the event loop\n\n 7.2. Prefer native JS methods over user-land utils like Lodash\nTL;DR: It's often more penalising to use utility libraries like lodash and underscore over native methods as it leads to unneeded dependencies and slower performance.\nBear in mind that with the introduction of the new V8 engine alongside the new ES standards, native methods were improved in such a way that it's now about 50% more performant than utility libraries.\nOtherwise: You'll have to maintain less performant projects where you could have simply used what was already available or dealt with a few more lines in exchange of a few more files.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Native over user land utils\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\n8. Docker Best Practices\n\ud83c\udfc5 Many thanks to Bret Fisher from whom we learned many of the following practices\n\n 8.1 Use multi-stage builds for leaner and more secure Docker images\nTL;DR: Use multi-stage build to copy only necessary production artifacts. A lot of build-time dependencies and files are not needed for running your application. With multi-stage builds these resources can be used during build while the runtime environment contains only what's necessary. Multi-stage builds are an easy way to get rid of overweight and security threats.\nOtherwise: Larger images will take longer to build and ship, build-only tools might contain vulnerabilities and secrets only meant for the build phase might be leaked.\nExample Dockerfile for multi-stage builds\nFROM node:14.4.0 AS build\n\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm ci && npm run build\n\nFROM node:slim-14.4.0\n\nUSER node\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nCOPY --from=build \/home\/node\/app\/dist \/home\/node\/app\/package.json \/home\/node\/app\/package-lock.json .\/\nRUN npm ci --production\n\nCMD [ \"node\", \"dist\/app.js\" ]\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Use multi-stage builds\n\n 8.2. Bootstrap using 'node' command, avoid npm start\nTL;DR: use CMD ['node','server.js'] to start your app, avoid using npm scripts which don't pass OS signals to the code. This prevents problems with child-process, signal handling, graceful shutdown and having zombie processes.\nOtherwise: When no signals are passed, your code will never be notified about shutdowns. Without this, it will lose its chance to close properly possibly losing current requests and\/or data.\nRead More: Bootstrap container using node command, avoid npm start\n\n 8.3. Let the Docker runtime handle replication and uptime\nTL;DR: When using a Docker run time orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes), invoke the Node.js process directly without intermediate process managers or custom code that replicate the process (e.g. PM2, Cluster module). The runtime platform has the highest amount of data and visibility for making placement decision - It knows best how many processes are needed, how to spread them and what to do in case of crashes\nOtherwise: Container keeps crashing due to lack of resources will get restarted indefinitely by the process manager. Should Kubernetes be aware of that, it could relocate it to a different roomy instance\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Let the Docker orchestrator restart and replicate processes\n\n 8.4. Use .dockerignore to prevent leaking secrets\nTL;DR: Include a .dockerignore file that filters out common secret files and development artifacts. By doing so, you might prevent secrets from leaking into the image. As a bonus the build time will significantly decrease. Also, ensure not to copy all files recursively rather explicitly choose what should be copied to Docker\nOtherwise: Common personal secret files like .env, .aws and .npmrc will be shared with anybody with access to the image (e.g. Docker repository)\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Use .dockerignore\n\n 8.5. Clean-up dependencies before production\nTL;DR: Although Dev-Dependencies are sometimes needed during the build and test life-cycle, eventually the image that is shipped to production should be minimal and clean from development dependencies. Doing so guarantees that only necessary code is shipped and the amount of potential attacks (i.e. attack surface) is minimized. When using multi-stage build (see dedicated bullet) this can be achieved by installing all dependencies first and finally running npm ci --production\nOtherwise: Many of the infamous npm security breaches were found within development packages (e.g. eslint-scope)\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Remove development dependencies\n\n 8.6. Shutdown smartly and gracefully\nTL;DR: Handle the process SIGTERM event and clean-up all existing connection and resources. This should be done while responding to ongoing requests. In Dockerized runtimes shutting down containers is not a rare event, rather a frequent occurrence that happen as part of routine work. Achieving this demands some thoughtful code to orchestrate several moving parts: The load balancer, keep-alive connections, the HTTP server and other resources\nOtherwise: Dying immediately means not responding to thousands of disappointed users\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Graceful shutdown\n\n 8.7. Set memory limits using both Docker and v8\nTL;DR: Always configure a memory limit using both Docker and the JavaScript runtime flags. The Docker limit is needed to make thoughtful container placement decision, the --v8's flag max-old-space is needed to kick off the GC on time and prevent under utilization of memory. Practically, set the v8's old space memory to be a just bit less than the container limit\nOtherwise: The docker definition is needed to perform thoughtful scaling decision and prevent starving other citizens. Without also defining the v8's limits, it will under utilize the container resources - Without explicit instructions it crashes when utilizing ~50-60% of its host resources\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Set memory limits using Docker only\n\n 8.8. Plan for efficient caching\nTL;DR: Rebuilding a whole docker image from cache can be nearly instantaneous if done correctly. The less updated instructions should be at the top of your Dockerfile and the ones constantly changing (like app code) should be at the bottom.\nOtherwise: Docker build will be very long and consume lot of resources even when making tiny changes\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Leverage caching to reduce build times\n\n 8.9. Use explicit image reference, avoid latest tag\nTL;DR: Specify an explicit image digest or versioned label, never refer to latest. Developers are often led to believe that specifying the latest tag will provide them with the most recent image in the repository however this is not the case. Using a digest guarantees that every instance of the service is running exactly the same code.\nIn addition, referring to an image tag means that the base image is subject to change, as image tags cannot be relied upon for a deterministic install. Instead, if a deterministic install is expected, a SHA256 digest can be used to reference an exact image.\nOtherwise: A new version of a base image could be deployed into production with breaking changes, causing unintended application behaviour.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Understand image tags and use the \"latest\" tag with caution\n\n 8.10. Prefer smaller Docker base images\nTL;DR: Large images lead to higher exposure to vulnerabilities and increased resource consumption. Using leaner Docker images, such as Slim and Alpine Linux variants, mitigates this issue.\nOtherwise: Building, pushing, and pulling images will take longer, unknown attack vectors can be used by malicious actors and more resources are consumed.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Prefer smaller images\n\n 8.11. Clean-out build-time secrets, avoid secrets in args\nTL;DR: Avoid secrets leaking from the Docker build environment. A Docker image is typically shared in multiple environment like CI and a registry that are not as sanitized as production. A typical example is an npm token which is usually passed to a dockerfile as argument. This token stays within the image long after it is needed and allows the attacker indefinite access to a private npm registry. This can be avoided by coping a secret file like .npmrc and then removing it using multi-stage build (beware, build history should be deleted as well) or by using Docker build-kit secret feature which leaves zero traces\nOtherwise: Everyone with access to the CI and docker registry will also get access to some precious organization secrets as a bonus\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Clean-out build-time secrets\n\n 8.12. Scan images for multi layers of vulnerabilities\nTL;DR: Besides checking code dependencies vulnerabilities also scan the final image that is shipped to production. Docker image scanners check the code dependencies but also the OS binaries. This E2E security scan covers more ground and verifies that no bad guy injected bad things during the build. Consequently, it is recommended running this as the last step before deployment. There are a handful of free and commercial scanners that also provide CI\/CD plugins\nOtherwise: Your code might be entirely free from vulnerabilities. However it might still get hacked due to vulnerable version of OS-level binaries (e.g. OpenSSL, TarBall) that are commonly being used by applications\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Generic Docker practices\n\n 8.13 Clean NODE_MODULE cache\nTL;DR: After installing dependencies in a container remove the local cache. It doesn't make any sense to duplicate the dependencies for faster future installs since there won't be any further installs - A Docker image is immutable. Using a single line of code tens of MB (typically 10-50% of the image size) are shaved off\nOtherwise: The image that will get shipped to production will weigh 30% more due to files that will never get used\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Clean NODE_MODULE cache\n\n 8.14. Generic Docker practices\nTL;DR: This is a collection of Docker advice that is not related directly to Node.js - the Node implementation is not much different than any other language. Click read more to skim through.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Generic Docker practices\n\n 8.15. Lint your Dockerfile\nTL;DR: Linting your Dockerfile is an important step to identify issues in your Dockerfile which differ from best practices. By checking for potential flaws using a specialised Docker linter, performance and security improvements can be easily identified, saving countless hours of wasted time or security issues in production code.\nOtherwise: Mistakenely the Dockerfile creator left Root as the production user, and also used an image from unknown source repository. This could be avoided with with just a simple linter.\n\ud83d\udd17 Read More: Lint your Dockerfile\n\n\u2b06 Return to top\nMilestones\nTo maintain this guide and keep it up to date, we are constantly updating and improving the guidelines and best practices with the help of the community.

To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:\n\nGetting Involved\nCore Style Guide\nWriting Code for jQuery Foundation Projects\n\nEnvironments in which to use jQuery\n\nBrowser support\njQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.\n\nWhat you need to build your own jQuery\nTo build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js\/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.\nFor Windows, you have to download and install git and Node.js.\nmacOS users should install Homebrew. Once Homebrew is installed, run brew install git to install git,\nand brew install node to install Node.js.\nLinux\/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source\nif you swing that way. Easy-peasy.\nHow to build your own jQuery\nFirst, clone the jQuery git repo.\nThen, enter the jquery directory and run the build script:\ncd jquery && npm run build\nThe built version of jQuery will be put in the dist\/ subdirectory, along with the minified copy and associated map file.\nIf you want to create custom build or help with jQuery development, it would be better to install grunt command line interface as a global package:\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\n\nMake sure you have grunt installed by testing:\ngrunt -V\n\nNow by running the grunt command, in the jquery directory, you can build a full version of jQuery, just like with an npm run build command:\ngrunt\n\nThere are many other tasks available for jQuery Core:\ngrunt -help\n\nModules\nSpecial builds can be created that exclude subsets of jQuery functionality.\nThis allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of jQuery are not being used.\nFor example, an app that only used JSONP for $.ajax() and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajax\/xhr modules.\nAny module may be excluded except for core, and selector. To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the src folder (without the .js extension).\nSome example modules that can be excluded are:\n\najax: All AJAX functionality: $.ajax(), $.get(), $.post(), $.ajaxSetup(), .load(), transports, and ajax event shorthands such as .ajaxStart().\najax\/xhr: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.\najax\/script: The <script> AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.\najax\/jsonp: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax\/script transport.\ncss: The .css() method. Also removes all modules depending on css (including effects, dimensions, and offset).\ncss\/showHide:  Non-animated .show(), .hide() and .toggle(); can be excluded if you use classes or explicit .css() calls to set the display property. Also removes the effects module.\ndeprecated: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.\ndimensions: The .width() and .height() methods, including inner- and outer- variations.\neffects: The .animate() method and its shorthands such as .slideUp() or .hide(\"slow\").\nevent: The .on() and .off() methods and all event functionality.\nevent\/trigger: The .trigger() and .triggerHandler() methods.\noffset: The .offset(), .position(), .offsetParent(), .scrollLeft(), and .scrollTop() methods.\nwrap: The .wrap(), .wrapAll(), .wrapInner(), and .unwrap() methods.\ncore\/ready: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with jQuery() will simply be called immediately. However, jQuery(document).ready() will not be a function and .on(\"ready\", ...) or similar will not be triggered.\ndeferred: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also removes jQuery.Callbacks. Note that modules that depend on jQuery.Deferred(AJAX, effects, core\/ready) will not be removed and will still expect jQuery.Deferred to be there. Include your own jQuery.Deferred implementation or exclude those modules as well (grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core\/ready).\nexports\/global: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.\nexports\/amd: Exclude the AMD definition.\n\nThe build process shows a message for each dependent module it excludes or includes.\nAMD name\nAs an option, you can set the module name for jQuery's AMD definition. By default, it is set to \"jquery\", which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you'd like to change this. Simply set the \"amd\" option:\ngrunt custom --amd=\"custom-name\"\nOr, to define anonymously, set the name to an empty string.\ngrunt custom --amd=\"\"\nCustom Build Examples\nTo create a custom build, first check out the version:\ngit pull; git checkout VERSION\nWhere VERSION is the version you want to customize. Then, make sure all Node dependencies are installed:\nnpm install\nCreate the custom build using the grunt custom option, listing the modules to be excluded.\nExclude all ajax functionality:\ngrunt custom:-ajax\nExcluding css removes modules depending on CSS: effects, offset, dimensions.\ngrunt custom:-css\nExclude a bunch of modules:\ngrunt custom:-ajax\/jsonp,-css,-deprecated,-dimensions,-effects,-offset,-wrap\nThere is also a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build is generated:\ngrunt custom:slim\nFor questions or requests regarding custom builds, please start a thread on the Developing jQuery Core section of the forum. Due to the combinatorics and custom nature of these builds, they are not regularly tested in jQuery's unit test process.\nRunning the Unit Tests\nMake sure you have the necessary dependencies:\nnpm install\nStart grunt watch or npm start to auto-build jQuery as you work:\ngrunt watch\nRun the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the \"test\" directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:\n\nWindows: WAMP download\nMac: MAMP download\nLinux: Setting up LAMP\nMongoose (most platforms)\n\nBuilding to a different directory\nTo copy the built jQuery files from \/dist to another directory:\ngrunt && grunt dist:\/path\/to\/special\/location\/\nWith this example, the output files would be:\n\/path\/to\/special\/location\/jquery.js\n\/path\/to\/special\/location\/jquery.min.js\nTo add a permanent copy destination, create a file in dist\/ called \".destination.json\". Inside the file, paste and customize the following:\n{\n  \"\/Absolute\/path\/to\/other\/destination\": true\n}\nAdditionally, both methods can be combined.\nEssential Git\nAs the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it's useful to know some features used.\nCleaning\nIf you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you've worked on is gone after these):\ngit reset --hard upstream\/master\ngit clean -fdx\nRebasing\nFor feature\/topic branches, you should always use the --rebase flag to git pull, or if you are usually handling many temporary \"to be in a github pull request\" branches, run the following to automate this:\ngit config branch.autosetuprebase local\n(see man git-config for more information)\nHandling merge conflicts\nIf you're getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature\ngit mergetool. Even though the default tool xxdiff looks awful\/old, it's rather useful.\nThe following are some commands that can be used there:\n\nCtrl + Alt + M - automerge as much as possible\nb - jump to next merge conflict\ns - change the order of the conflicted lines\nu - undo a merge\nleft mouse button - mark a block to be the winner\nmiddle mouse button - mark a line to be the winner\nCtrl + S - save\nCtrl + Q - quit\n\nQUnit Reference\nTest methods\nexpect( numAssertions );\nstop();\nstart();\nNote: QUnit's eventual addition of an argument to stop\/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.\nTest assertions\nok( value, [message] );\nequal( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\ndeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nstrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nthrows( block, [expected], [message] );\nTest Suite Convenience Methods Reference (See test\/data\/testinit.js)\nReturns an array of elements with the given IDs\nq( ... );\nExample:\nq(\"main\", \"foo\", \"bar\");\n\n=> [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]\nAsserts that a selection matches the given IDs\nt( testName, selector, [ \"array\", \"of\", \"ids\" ] );\nExample:\nt(\"Check for something\", \"\/\/[a]\", [\"foo\", \"bar\"]);\nFires a native DOM event without going through jQuery\nfireNative( node, eventType )\nExample:\nfireNative( jQuery(\"#elem\")[0], \"click\" );\nAdd random number to url to stop caching\nurl( \"some\/url\" );\nExample:\nurl(\"index.html\");\n\n=> \"data\/index.html?10538358428943\"\n\n\nurl(\"mock.php?foo=bar\");\n\n=> \"data\/mock.php?foo=bar&10538358345554\"\nRun tests in an iframe\nSome tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and\nthese can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions\nremain in jQuery's main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup\nand setup code should be placed in the iframe file.\ntestIframe( testName, fileName,\n  function testCallback(\n      assert, jQuery, window, document,\n\t  [ additional args ] ) {\n\t...\n  } );\nThis loads a page, constructing a url with fileName \".\/data\/\" + fileName.\nThe iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by\nincluding the \"\/test\/data\/iframeTest.js\" script and calling\nstartIframeTest( [ additional args ] ) when appropriate. Often this\nwill be after either document ready or window.onload fires.\nThe testCallback receives the QUnit assert object created by testIframe\nfor this test, followed by the global jQuery, window, and document from\nthe iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to startIframeTest,\nthey follow the document argument.\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the\nDeveloping jQuery Core forum or in #jquery on irc.freenode.net.\n","20":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreveal.js is an open source HTML presentation framework.

You can find the source to the manual in atom\/flight-manual.atom.io.\nThe API reference for developing packages is also documented on Atom.io.\nInstalling\nPrerequisites\n\nGit\n\nmacOS\nDownload the latest Atom release.\nAtom will automatically update when a new release is available.\nWindows\nDownload the latest Atom installer. AtomSetup.exe is 32-bit. For 64-bit systems, download AtomSetup-x64.exe.\nAtom will automatically update when a new release is available.\nYou can also download atom-windows.zip (32-bit) or atom-x64-windows.zip (64-bit) from the releases page.\nThe .zip version will not automatically update.\nUsing Chocolatey? Run cinst Atom to install the latest version of Atom.\nLinux\nAtom is only available for 64-bit Linux systems.\nConfigure your distribution's package manager to install and update Atom by following the Linux installation instructions in the Flight Manual.  You will also find instructions on how to install Atom's official Linux packages without using a package repository, though you will not get automatic updates after installing Atom this way.\nArchive extraction\nAn archive is available for people who don't want to install atom as root.\nThis version enables you to install multiple Atom versions in parallel. It has been built on Ubuntu 64-bit,\nbut should be compatible with other Linux distributions.\n\nInstall dependencies (on Ubuntu): sudo apt install git gconf2 gconf-service libgtk2.0-0 libudev1 libgcrypt20 libnotify4 libxtst6 libnss3 python3 gvfs-bin xdg-utils libcap2\n\n(If the python3 package isn't available, or is too old (Python 3 should be >= 3.5), either python2 or python (2.6 or 2.7) will work in its place.)\n\n\nDownload atom-amd64.tar.gz from the Atom releases page.\nRun tar xf atom-amd64.tar.gz in the directory where you want to extract the Atom folder.\nLaunch Atom using the installed atom command from the newly extracted directory.\n\nThe Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to\nrepeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.\nBuilding\n\nLinux\nmacOS\nWindows\n\nDiscussion\n\nDiscuss Atom on our forums\nChat about Atom on our Slack team -- instructions for joining\n\nLicense\nMIT\nWhen using the Atom or other GitHub logos, be sure to follow the GitHub logo guidelines.\n","22":"socket.io\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\nSocket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It consists of:\n\na Node.js server (this repository)\na Javascript client library for the browser (or a Node.js client)\n\nSome implementations in other languages are also available:\n\nJava\nC++\nSwift\nDart\n\nIts main features are:\nReliability\nConnections are established even in the presence of:\n\nproxies and load balancers.\npersonal firewall and antivirus software.\n\nFor this purpose, it relies on Engine.IO, which first establishes a long-polling connection, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are \"tested\" on the side, like WebSocket. Please see the Goals section for more information.\nAuto-reconnection support\nUnless instructed otherwise a disconnected client will try to reconnect forever, until the server is available again. Please see the available reconnection options here.\nDisconnection detection\nA heartbeat mechanism is implemented at the Engine.IO level, allowing both the server and the client to know when the other one is not responding anymore.\nThat functionality is achieved with timers set on both the server and the client, with timeout values (the pingInterval and pingTimeout parameters) shared during the connection handshake. Those timers require any subsequent client calls to be directed to the same server, hence the sticky-session requirement when using multiples nodes.\nBinary support\nAny serializable data structures can be emitted, including:\n\nArrayBuffer and Blob in the browser\nArrayBuffer and Buffer in Node.js\n\nSimple and convenient API\nSample code:\nio.on('connection', socket => {\n  socket.emit('request', \/* \u2026 *\/); \/\/ emit an event to the socket\n  io.emit('broadcast', \/* \u2026 *\/); \/\/ emit an event to all connected sockets\n  socket.on('reply', () => { \/* \u2026 *\/ }); \/\/ listen to the event\n});\nCross-browser\nBrowser support is tested in Sauce Labs:\n\nMultiplexing support\nIn order to create separation of concerns within your application (for example per module, or based on permissions), Socket.IO allows you to create several Namespaces, which will act as separate communication channels but will share the same underlying connection.\nRoom support\nWithin each Namespace, you can define arbitrary channels, called Rooms, that sockets can join and leave. You can then broadcast to any given room, reaching every socket that has joined it.\nThis is a useful feature to send notifications to a group of users, or to a given user connected on several devices for example.\nNote: Socket.IO is not a WebSocket implementation. Although Socket.IO indeed uses WebSocket as a transport when possible, it adds some metadata to each packet: the packet type, the namespace and the ack id when a message acknowledgement is needed. That is why a WebSocket client will not be able to successfully connect to a Socket.IO server, and a Socket.IO client will not be able to connect to a WebSocket server (like ws:\/\/echo.websocket.org) either. Please see the protocol specification here.\nInstallation\nnpm install socket.io\nHow to use\nThe following example attaches socket.io to a plain Node.JS\nHTTP server listening on port 3000.\nconst server = require('http').createServer();\nconst io = require('socket.io')(server);\nio.on('connection', client => {\n  client.on('event', data => { \/* \u2026 *\/ });\n  client.on('disconnect', () => { \/* \u2026 *\/ });\n});\nserver.listen(3000);\nStandalone\nconst io = require('socket.io')();\nio.on('connection', client => { ... });\nio.listen(3000);\nIn conjunction with Express\nStarting with 3.0, express applications have become request handler\nfunctions that you pass to http or http Server instances. You need\nto pass the Server to socket.io, and not the express application\nfunction. Also make sure to call .listen on the server, not the app.\nconst app = require('express')();\nconst server = require('http').createServer(app);\nconst io = require('socket.io')(server);\nio.on('connection', () => { \/* \u2026 *\/ });\nserver.listen(3000);\nIn conjunction with Koa\nLike Express.JS, Koa works by exposing an application as a request\nhandler function, but only by calling the callback method.\nconst app = require('koa')();\nconst server = require('http').createServer(app.callback());\nconst io = require('socket.io')(server);\nio.on('connection', () => { \/* \u2026 *\/ });\nserver.listen(3000);\nIn conjunction with Fastify\nTo integrate Socket.io in your Fastify application you just need to\nregister fastify-socket.io plugin. It will create a decorator\ncalled io.\nconst app = require('fastify')();\napp.register(require('fastify-socket.io'));\napp.io.on('connection', () => { \/* \u2026 *\/ });\napp.listen(3000);\nDocumentation\nPlease see the documentation here.\nThe source code of the website can be found here. Contributions are welcome!\nDebug \/ logging\nSocket.IO is powered by debug.\nIn order to see all the debug output, run your app with the environment variable\nDEBUG including the desired scope.\nTo see the output from all of Socket.IO's debugging scopes you can use:\nDEBUG=socket.io* node myapp\n\nTesting\nnpm test\n\nThis runs the gulp task test. By default the test will be run with the source code in lib directory.\nSet the environmental variable TEST_VERSION to compat to test the transpiled es5-compat version of the code.\nThe gulp task test will always transpile the source code into es5 and export to dist first before running the test.\nBackers\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.

If you run the above code from another directory, it\u2019s better to use an absolute path:\nconst path = require('path')\nconst router = jsonServer.router(path.join(__dirname, 'db.json'))\nFor an in-memory database, simply pass an object to jsonServer.router().\nPlease note also that jsonServer.router() can be used in existing Express projects.\nCustom routes example\nLet's say you want a route that echoes query parameters and another one that set a timestamp on every resource created.\nconst jsonServer = require('json-server')\nconst server = jsonServer.create()\nconst router = jsonServer.router('db.json')\nconst middlewares = jsonServer.defaults()\n\n\/\/ Set default middlewares (logger, static, cors and no-cache)\nserver.use(middlewares)\n\n\/\/ Add custom routes before JSON Server router\nserver.get('\/echo', (req, res) => {\n  res.jsonp(req.query)\n})\n\n\/\/ To handle POST, PUT and PATCH you need to use a body-parser\n\/\/ You can use the one used by JSON Server\nserver.use(jsonServer.bodyParser)\nserver.use((req, res, next) => {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    req.body.createdAt = Date.now()\n  }\n  \/\/ Continue to JSON Server router\n  next()\n})\n\n\/\/ Use default router\nserver.use(router)\nserver.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('JSON Server is running')\n})\nAccess control example\nconst jsonServer = require('json-server')\nconst server = jsonServer.create()\nconst router = jsonServer.router('db.json')\nconst middlewares = jsonServer.defaults()\n\nserver.use(middlewares)\nserver.use((req, res, next) => {\n if (isAuthorized(req)) { \/\/ add your authorization logic here\n   next() \/\/ continue to JSON Server router\n } else {\n   res.sendStatus(401)\n }\n})\nserver.use(router)\nserver.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('JSON Server is running')\n})\nCustom output example\nTo modify responses, overwrite router.render method:\n\/\/ In this example, returned resources will be wrapped in a body property\nrouter.render = (req, res) => {\n  res.jsonp({\n    body: res.locals.data\n  })\n}\nYou can set your own status code for the response:\n\/\/ In this example we simulate a server side error response\nrouter.render = (req, res) => {\n  res.status(500).jsonp({\n    error: \"error message here\"\n  })\n}\nRewriter example\nTo add rewrite rules, use jsonServer.rewriter():\n\/\/ Add this before server.use(router)\nserver.use(jsonServer.rewriter({\n  '\/api\/*': '\/$1',\n  '\/blog\/:resource\/:id\/show': '\/:resource\/:id'\n}))\nMounting JSON Server on another endpoint example\nAlternatively, you can also mount the router on \/api.\nserver.use('\/api', router)\nAPI\njsonServer.create()\nReturns an Express server.\njsonServer.defaults([options])\nReturns middlewares used by JSON Server.\n\noptions\n\nstatic path to static files\nlogger enable logger middleware (default: true)\nbodyParser enable body-parser middleware (default: true)\nnoCors disable CORS (default: false)\nreadOnly accept only GET requests (default: false)\n\n\n\njsonServer.router([path|object])\nReturns JSON Server router.\nDeployment\nYou can deploy JSON Server.

It also supports syntax highlighting (just specify the language in a fenced code block).\nWriting email with code in it is pretty tedious. Writing Markdown with code in it is easy. I found myself writing email in Markdown in the Github in-browser editor, then copying the preview into email. This is a pretty absurd workflow, so I decided create a tool to write and render Markdown right in the email.\nTo discover what can be done with Markdown in Markdown Here, check out the Markdown Here Cheatsheet and the other wiki pages.\n\u2020: And Google Groups posts, and Blogger posts, and Evernote notes, and Wordpress posts! See more.\n\u2021: And TeX mathematical formulae!\n\nTable of Contents\nInstallation Instructions\nUsage Instructions\nTroubleshooting\nCompatibility\nNotes and Miscellaneous\nBuilding the Extension Bundles\nNext Steps, Credits, Feedback, License\nInstallation Instructions\nChrome\nChrome Web Store\nGo to the Chrome Web Store page for Markdown Here and install normally.\nAfter installing, make sure to reload your webmail or restart Chrome!\nManual\/Development\n\nClone this repo.\nIn Chrome, open the Extensions settings. (Wrench button, Tools, Extensions.)\nOn the Extensions settings page, click the \"Developer Mode\" checkbox.\nClick the now-visible \"Load unpacked extension\u2026\" button. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo, then the src directory under that.\nThe Markdown Here extension should now be visible in your extensions list.\nReload your webmail page (and maybe application) before trying to convert an email.\n\nFirefox and Thunderbird\nMozilla Add-ons site\nGo to the Firefox Add-ons page for Markdown Here and install normally.\nOr go to the \"Tools > Add-ons\" menu and then search for \"Markdown Here\".\nAfter installing, make sure to restart Firefox\/Thunderbird!\nNote: It takes up to a month for Mozilla to approve changes to the Firefox\/Thunderbird extension, so updates (features, fixes) will lag behind what is shown here. You can manually choose to install the newest version before it's reviewed from the list of versions: https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/markdown-here\/versions\/\nManual\/Development\n\nClone this repo.\nFollow the instructions in the MDN \"Setting up an extension development environment\" article.\n\nSafari\nDownload the extension directly. When it has finished downloading, double click it to install.\nPreferences\nTo get to the Markdown Here preferences, open the Safari preferences and then go to the \"Extensions\" tab. Then click the \"Click me to show Markdown Here options\" box.\nOpera\nNote that Markdown Here only works with Opera versions 16 and higher (i.e., the ones that are based on Chromium).\nGo to the Opera Add-ons store page for Markdown Here and install normally.\nAfter installing, make sure to reload your webmail or restart Chrome!\nUsage Instructions\nInstall it, and then\u2026\n\n\nIn Chrome\/Safari\/Opera, make sure you reload your web mail page before trying to use Markdown Here.\n\n\nIn Chrome\/Firefox\/Safari\/Opera, log into your Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account and start a new email. In Thunderbird, start a new message.\n\n\nMake sure you're using the rich editor.\n\nIn Gmail, click the \"Rich formatting\" link, if it's visible.\nIn Thunderbird, make sure \"Compose messages in HTML format\" is enabled in your \"Account Settings\", \"Composition & Addressing\" pane.\n\n\n\nCompose an email in Markdown. For example:\n**Hello** `world`.\n\n```javascript\nalert('Hello syntax highlighting.');\n```\n\n\n\nRight-click in the compose box and choose the \"Markdown Toggle\" item from the context menu. Or click the button that appears in your address bar. Or use the hotkey (CTRL+ALT+M by default).\n\n\nYou should see your email rendered correctly from Markdown into rich HTML.\n\n\nSend your awesome email to everyone you know. It will appear to them the same way it looks to you.\n\n\nRevert to Markdown\nAfter rendering your Markdown to pretty HTML, you can still get back to your original Markdown. Just right-click anywhere in the newly rendered Markdown and click \"Markdown Toggle\" -- your email compose body will change back to the Markdown you had written.\nNote that any changes you make to the pretty HTML will be lost when you revert to Markdown.\nIn Gmail, you can also use the browser's Undo command (CTRL+Z \/ CMD+Z, or from the Edit menu). Be warned that you might also lose the last few characters you entered.\nReplies\nIn Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can use \"Markdown Toggle\" normally: just write your reply (top, bottom, inline, wherever) and then convert. The original email that you're replying to will be left alone. (Technically: Existing blockquote blocks will be left intact.)\nIn Hotmail and Yahoo (which don't put the original in a blockquote), and optionally in Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can ensure that only the part of the reply that you wrote gets converted by selecting what you want to convert and then clicking \"Markdown Toggle\" -- see the next section.\nSelection\/Piecemeal Conversion\nSometimes you don't want to convert the entire email; sometimes your email isn't entirely Markdown. To convert only part of the email, select the text (with your mouse or keyboard), right-click on it, and click the \"Markdown Toggle\" menu item. Your selection is magically rendered into pretty HTML.\nTo revert back to Markdown, just put your cursor anywhere in the block of converted text, right click, and click the \"Markdown Toggle\" menu item again. Now it's magically back to the original Markdown.\n\nThings to know about converting\/reverting a selection\n\n\nIf you select only part of a block of text, only that text will be converted. The converted block will be wrapped in a paragraph element, so the original line will be broken up. You probably don't want to ever do this.\n\n\nYou can select and revert multiple converted blocks at the same time. One upshot of this is that you can select your entire email, click \"Markdown Toggle\", and all portions of it that you had converted will be reverted.\n\n\nIf you don't have anything selected when you click \"Markdown Toggle\", Markdown Here will check if there are converted blocks anywhere in the message and revert them. If there no converted blocks are found, it will convert the entire email.\n\n\nOptions\nThe Markdown Here Options page can be accessed via the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Thunderbird extensions list. The available options include:\n\nStyling modifications for the rendered Markdown.\nSyntax highlighting theme selection and modification.\nTeX math formulae processing enabling and customization.\nWhat the hotkey should be.\n\nFor Chrome and Firefox, any changes made in the Markdown Here Options are automatically synchronized between your other installations of that browser (if you have the sync feature enabled in the browser).\n\nTroubleshooting\nSee the Troubleshooting wiki page.\nCompatibility\nSee the Compatibility wiki page.\nNotes and Miscellaneous\n\n\nMarkdown Here uses Github Flavored Markdown, with the limitation that GFM special links are not supported (issue #11); nor will they be, as MDH is not Github-specific.\n\n\nAvailable languages for syntax highlighting (and the way they should be written in the fenced code block) can be seen on the highlight.js demo page.\n\n\nImages embedded inline in your Markdown will be retained when you \"Markdown Toggle\". Gmail allows you to put images inline in your email -- this can be much easier than referencing an external image.\n\n\nEmail signatures are automatically excluded from conversion. Specifically, anything after the semi-standard '-- ' (note the trailing space) is left alone.\n\nNote that Hotmail and Yahoo do not automatically add the '-- ' to signatures, so you have to add it yourself.\n\n\n\nThe \"Markdown Toggle\" menu item shows up for more element types than it can correctly render. This is intended to help people realize that they're not using a rich editor. Otherwise they just don't see the menu item and don't know why.\n\n\nStyling:\n\nThe use of browser-specific styles (-moz-, -webkit-) should be avoided. If used, they may not render correctly for people reading the email in a different browser from the one where the email was sent.\nThe use of state-dependent styles (like a:hover) don't work because they don't match at the time the styles are made explicit. (In email, styles must be explicitly applied to all elements -- stylesheets get stripped.)\n\n\n\nFor more tweaky features, visit the Tips and Tricks section.\n\n\nBuilding the Extension Bundles\ncd utils\nnode build.js\n\nChrome and Opera extension\nCreate a file with a .zip extension containing these files and directories:\nmanifest.json\ncommon\/\nchrome\/\n\nFirefox\/Thunderbird extension\nCreate a file with a .xpi extension containing these files and directories:\nchrome.manifest\ninstall.rdf\ncommon\/\nfirefox\/\n\nSafari extension\nThe browser-specific code is located in the markdown-here-safari project.\nUse the Safari Extension Builder.\nNext Steps\nSee the issues list and the Notes Wiki.

Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the\nlimitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps so you can create high-quality,\ndynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.\n\n\nUse a Modern Stack for Every Site. No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are\nbuilt using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of\nwhether the data is coming from the same backend.\n\n\nLoad Data From Anywhere. Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it\u2019s Markdown\nfiles, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins\nto load your data, then develop using Gatsby\u2019s uniform GraphQL interface.\n\n\nPerformance Is Baked In. Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code\nsplitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources,\nand more to ensure your site is fast \u2014 no manual tuning required.\n\n\nHost at Scale for Pennies. Gatsby sites don\u2019t require servers so you can host your entire\nsite on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be\nhosted entirely free on services like GitHub Pages and Netlify.\n\n\nLearn how to use Gatsby for your next project.\nWhat\u2019s In This Document\n\nGet Up and Running in 5 Minutes\nLearning Gatsby\nMigration Guides\nHow to Contribute\nLicense\nThanks to Our Contributors and Sponsors\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes\nYou can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:\n\n\nInstall the Gatsby CLI.\nnpm install -g gatsby-cli\n\n\n\nCreate a Gatsby site from a Gatsby starter.\nGet your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:\n# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter\ngatsby new my-blazing-fast-site\n\n\nStart the site in develop mode.\nNext, move into your new site\u2019s directory and start it up:\ncd my-blazing-fast-site\/\ngatsby develop\n\n\nOpen the source code and start editing!\nYour site is now running at http:\/\/localhost:8000.

It does not impose a specific development\nphilosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the\nway that you want.\n\nHomepage: https:\/\/html5boilerplate.com\/\nSource: https:\/\/github.com\/h5bp\/html5-boilerplate\nTwitter: @h5bp\n\nQuick start\nChoose one of the following options:\n\n\nDownload the latest stable release from\nhtml5boilerplate.com. This zip file is a\nsnapshot of the dist folder. On Windows, Mac and from the file manager on\nLinux unzipping this folder will output to a folder named something like\nhtml5-boilerplate_v7.3.0. From the command line will need to create a\nfolder and unzip the contents into that folder.\nmkdir html5-boilerplate\nunzip html5-boilerplate*.zip -d html5-boilerplate\n\n\nClone the git repo \u2014 git clone https:\/\/github.com\/h5bp\/html5-boilerplate.git - and checkout the\ntagged release\nyou'd like to use. The dist folder represents the latest version of the\nproject for end users.\n\n\nInstall with npm: npm install html5-boilerplate\nor yarn: yarn add html5-boilerplate. The resulting\nnode_modules\/html5-boilerplate\/dist folder represents the latest version of\nthe project for end users. Depending on what you want to use and how you want\nto use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into\nyour project directory.\n\n\nUsing our new create-html5-boilerplate\nproject, instantly fetch the latest npm published package (or any version\navailable on npm) with npx, npm init or yarn create without having to\ninstall any dependencies. Running the following npx command installs the\nlatest version into a folder called new-site\nnpx create-html5-boilerplate new-site\ncd new-site\nnpm install\nnpm start\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nA finely-tuned starter template. Reap the benefits of 10 years of analysis,\nresearch and experimentation by over 200 contributors.\nDesigned with progressive enhancement in mind.\nIncludes:\n\nNormalize.css\nfor CSS normalizations and common bug fixes\nA custom build of Modernizr for feature\ndetection\nApache Server Configs\nthat improve the web site's performance and security\n\n\nPlaceholder Open Graph elements and attributes.\nAn example package.json file with Parcel commands\nbuilt in to jumpstart application development\nPlaceholder CSS Media Queries.\nUseful CSS helper classes.\nDefault print styles, performance optimized.\nAn optimized version of the Google Universal Analytics snippet.\nProtection against any stray console statements causing JavaScript\nerrors in older browsers.\n\"Delete-key friendly.\" Easy to strip out parts you don't need.\nExtensive documentation.\n\nBrowser support\n\nChrome (latest 2)\nEdge (latest 2)\nFirefox (latest 2)\nInternet Explorer 11\nOpera (latest 2)\nSafari (latest 2)\n\nThis doesn't mean that HTML5 Boilerplate cannot be used in older browsers,\njust that we'll ensure compatibility with the ones mentioned above.\nIf you need legacy browser support you can use HTML5 Boilerplate v6 (IE9\/IE10)\nor HTML5 Boilerplate v5\n(IE 8). They are no longer actively developed.\nDocumentation\nTake a look at the documentation table of contents. This\ndocumentation is bundled with the project which makes it available for offline\nreading and provides a useful starting point for any documentation you want to\nwrite about your project.\nContributing\nHundreds of developers have helped to make the HTML5 Boilerplate.

Martin's book\nClean Code,\nadapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing\nreadable, reusable, and refactorable software in JavaScript.\nNot every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be\nuniversally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are\nones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of\nClean Code.\nOur craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are\nstill learning a lot. When software architecture is as old as architecture\nitself, maybe then we will have harder rules to follow. For now, let these\nguidelines serve as a touchstone by which to assess the quality of the\nJavaScript code that you and your team produce.\nOne more thing: knowing these won't immediately make you a better software\ndeveloper, and working with them for many years doesn't mean you won't make\nmistakes. Every piece of code starts as a first draft, like wet clay getting\nshaped into its final form. Finally, we chisel away the imperfections when\nwe review it with our peers. Don't beat yourself up for first drafts that need\nimprovement. Beat up the code instead!\nVariables\nUse meaningful and pronounceable variable names\nBad:\nconst yyyymmdstr = moment().format(\"YYYY\/MM\/DD\");\nGood:\nconst currentDate = moment().format(\"YYYY\/MM\/DD\");\n\u2b06 back to top\nUse the same vocabulary for the same type of variable\nBad:\ngetUserInfo();\ngetClientData();\ngetCustomerRecord();\nGood:\ngetUser();\n\u2b06 back to top\nUse searchable names\nWe will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we\ndo write is readable and searchable. By not naming variables that end up\nbeing meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.\nMake your names searchable. Tools like\nbuddy.js and\nESLint\ncan help identify unnamed constants.\nBad:\n\/\/ What the heck is 86400000 for?\nsetTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);\nGood:\n\/\/ Declare them as capitalized named constants.\nconst MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000; \/\/86400000;\n\nsetTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY);\n\u2b06 back to top\nUse explanatory variables\nBad:\nconst address = \"One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014\";\nconst cityZipCodeRegex = \/^[^,\\\\]+[,\\\\\\s]+(.+?)\\s*(\\d{5})?$\/;\nsaveCityZipCode(\n  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],\n  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]\n);\nGood:\nconst address = \"One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014\";\nconst cityZipCodeRegex = \/^[^,\\\\]+[,\\\\\\s]+(.+?)\\s*(\\d{5})?$\/;\nconst [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];\nsaveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);\n\u2b06 back to top\nAvoid Mental Mapping\nExplicit is better than implicit.\nBad:\nconst locations = [\"Austin\", \"New York\", \"San Francisco\"];\nlocations.forEach(l => {\n  doStuff();\n  doSomeOtherStuff();\n  \/\/ ...\n  \/\/ ...\n  \/\/ ...\n  \/\/ Wait, what is `l` for again?\n  dispatch(l);\n});\nGood:\nconst locations = [\"Austin\", \"New York\", \"San Francisco\"];\nlocations.forEach(location => {\n  doStuff();\n  doSomeOtherStuff();\n  \/\/ ...\n  \/\/ ...\n  \/\/ ...\n  dispatch(location);\n});\n\u2b06 back to top\nDon't add unneeded context\nIf your class\/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your\nvariable name.\nBad:\nconst Car = {\n  carMake: \"Honda\",\n  carModel: \"Accord\",\n  carColor: \"Blue\"\n};\n\nfunction paintCar(car) {\n  car.carColor = \"Red\";\n}\nGood:\nconst Car = {\n  make: \"Honda\",\n  model: \"Accord\",\n  color: \"Blue\"\n};\n\nfunction paintCar(car) {\n  car.color = \"Red\";\n}\n\u2b06 back to top\nUse default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals\nDefault arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you\nuse them, your function will only provide default values for undefined\narguments. Other \"falsy\" values such as '', \"\", false, null, 0, and\nNaN, will not be replaced by a default value.\nBad:\nfunction createMicrobrewery(name) {\n  const breweryName = name || \"Hipster Brew Co.\";\n  \/\/ ...\n}\nGood:\nfunction createMicrobrewery(name = \"Hipster Brew Co.\") {\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n\u2b06 back to top\nFunctions\nFunction arguments (2 or fewer ideally)\nLimiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it\nmakes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a\ncombinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with\neach separate argument.\nOne or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.\nAnything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have\nmore than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases\nwhere it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an\nargument.\nSince JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class\nboilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a\nlot of arguments.\nTo make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015\/ES6\ndestructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:\n\nWhen someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what\nproperties are being used.\nIt can be used to simulate named parameters.\nDestructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument\nobject passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note:\nobjects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT\ncloned.\nLinters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible\nwithout destructuring.\n\nBad:\nfunction createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n\ncreateMenu(\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\", true);\nGood:\nfunction createMenu({ title, body, buttonText, cancellable }) {\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n\ncreateMenu({\n  title: \"Foo\",\n  body: \"Bar\",\n  buttonText: \"Baz\",\n  cancellable: true\n});\n\u2b06 back to top\nFunctions should do one thing\nThis is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions\ndo more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.\nWhen you can isolate a function to just one action, it can be refactored\neasily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from\nthis guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.\nBad:\nfunction emailClients(clients) {\n  clients.forEach(client => {\n    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);\n    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {\n      email(client);\n    }\n  });\n}\nGood:\nfunction emailActiveClients(clients) {\n  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);\n}\n\nfunction isActiveClient(client) {\n  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);\n  return clientRecord.isActive();\n}\n\u2b06 back to top\nFunction names should say what they do\nBad:\nfunction addToDate(date, month) {\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n\nconst date = new Date();\n\n\/\/ It's hard to tell from the function name what is added\naddToDate(date, 1);\nGood:\nfunction addMonthToDate(month, date) {\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n\nconst date = new Date();\naddMonthToDate(1, date);\n\u2b06 back to top\nFunctions should only be one level of abstraction\nWhen you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually\ndoing too much.

Duplicate code is bad because it\nmeans that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to change\nsome logic.\nImagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your\ntomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that\nyou keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with\ntomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!\nOftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly\ndifferent things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you\nto have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing\nduplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of\ndifferent things with just one function\/module\/class.\nGetting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the\nSOLID principles laid out in the Classes section. Bad abstractions can be\nworse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make\na good abstraction, do it!

A side effect could be writing to a file,\nmodifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a\nstranger.\nNow, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous\nexample, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to\ncentralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes\nthat write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.\nThe main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects\nwithout any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,\nand not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will\nbe happier than the vast majority of other programmers.\nBad:\n\/\/ Global variable referenced by following function.\n\/\/ If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.\nlet name = \"Ryan McDermott\";\n\nfunction splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {\n  name = name.split(\" \");\n}\n\nsplitIntoFirstAndLastName();\n\nconsole.log(name); \/\/ ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];\nGood:\nfunction splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {\n  return name.split(\" \");\n}\n\nconst name = \"Ryan McDermott\";\nconst newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);\n\nconsole.log(name); \/\/ 'Ryan McDermott';\nconsole.log(newName); \/\/ ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];\n\u2b06 back to top\nAvoid Side Effects (part 2)\nIn JavaScript, some values are unchangeable (immutable) and some are changeable\n(mutable). Objects and arrays are two kinds of mutable values so it's important\nto handle them carefully when they're passed as parameters to a function. A\nJavaScript function can change an object's properties or alter the contents of\nan array which could easily cause bugs elsewhere.\nSuppose there's a function that accepts an array parameter representing a\nshopping cart. If the function makes a change in that shopping cart array -\nby adding an item to purchase, for example - then any other function that\nuses that same cart array will be affected by this addition. That may be\ngreat, however it could also be bad. Let's imagine a bad situation:\nThe user clicks the \"Purchase\" button which calls a purchase function that\nspawns a network request and sends the cart array to the server. Because\nof a bad network connection, the purchase function has to keep retrying the\nrequest. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks an \"Add to Cart\"\nbutton on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?\nIf that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function\nwill send the accidentally added item because the cart array was modified.\nA great solution would be for the addItemToCart function to always clone the\ncart, edit it, and return the clone. This would ensure that functions that are still\nusing the old shopping cart wouldn't be affected by the changes.\nTwo caveats to mention to this approach:\n\n\nThere might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,\nbut when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases\nare pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!\n\n\nCloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,\nthis isn't a big issue in practice because there are\ngreat libraries that allow\nthis kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as\nit would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.\n\n\nBad:\nconst addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {\n  cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });\n};\nGood:\nconst addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {\n  return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];\n};\n\u2b06 back to top\nDon't write to global functions\nPolluting globals is a bad practice in JavaScript because you could clash with another\nlibrary and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an\nexception in production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to\nextend JavaScript's native Array method to have a diff method that could\nshow the difference between two arrays? You could write your new function\nto the Array.prototype, but it could clash with another library that tried\nto do the same thing. What if that other library was just using diff to find\nthe difference between the first and last elements of an array? This is why it\nwould be much better to just use ES2015\/ES6 classes and simply extend the Array global.\nBad:\nArray.prototype.diff = function diff(comparisonArray) {\n  const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);\n  return this.filter(elem => !hash.has(elem));\n};\nGood:\nclass SuperArray extends Array {\n  diff(comparisonArray) {\n    const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);\n    return this.filter(elem => !hash.has(elem));\n  }\n}\n\u2b06 back to top\nFavor functional programming over imperative programming\nJavaScript isn't a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has\na functional flavor to it.

It's formally defined as \"If S\nis a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S\n(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any\nof the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed,\netc.).\" That's an even scarier definition.\nThe best explanation for this is if you have a parent class and a child class,\nthen the base class and child class can be used interchangeably without getting\nincorrect results. This might still be confusing, so let's take a look at the\nclassic Square-Rectangle example. Mathematically, a square is a rectangle, but\nif you model it using the \"is-a\" relationship via inheritance, you quickly\nget into trouble.\nBad:\nclass Rectangle {\n  constructor() {\n    this.width = 0;\n    this.height = 0;\n  }\n\n  setColor(color) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n\n  render(area) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n\n  setWidth(width) {\n    this.width = width;\n  }\n\n  setHeight(height) {\n    this.height = height;\n  }\n\n  getArea() {\n    return this.width * this.height;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Square extends Rectangle {\n  setWidth(width) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = width;\n  }\n\n  setHeight(height) {\n    this.width = height;\n    this.height = height;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction renderLargeRectangles(rectangles) {\n  rectangles.forEach(rectangle => {\n    rectangle.setWidth(4);\n    rectangle.setHeight(5);\n    const area = rectangle.getArea(); \/\/ BAD: Returns 25 for Square.

However, it's important and relevant even with JavaScript's lack of\ntype system.\nISP states that \"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that\nthey do not use.\" Interfaces are implicit contracts in JavaScript because of\nduck typing.\nA good example to look at that demonstrates this principle in JavaScript is for\nclasses that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to setup\nhuge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need\nall of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a\n\"fat interface\".\nBad:\nclass DOMTraverser {\n  constructor(settings) {\n    this.settings = settings;\n    this.setup();\n  }\n\n  setup() {\n    this.rootNode = this.settings.rootNode;\n    this.settings.animationModule.setup();\n  }\n\n  traverse() {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n}\n\nconst $ = new DOMTraverser({\n  rootNode: document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\"),\n  animationModule() {} \/\/ Most of the time, we won't need to animate when traversing.\n  \/\/ ...\n});\nGood:\nclass DOMTraverser {\n  constructor(settings) {\n    this.settings = settings;\n    this.options = settings.options;\n    this.setup();\n  }\n\n  setup() {\n    this.rootNode = this.settings.rootNode;\n    this.setupOptions();\n  }\n\n  setupOptions() {\n    if (this.options.animationModule) {\n      \/\/ ...\n    }\n  }\n\n  traverse() {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n}\n\nconst $ = new DOMTraverser({\n  rootNode: document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\"),\n  options: {\n    animationModule() {}\n  }\n});\n\u2b06 back to top\nDependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\nThis principle states two essential things:\n\nHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should\ndepend on abstractions.\nAbstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on\nabstractions.\n\nThis can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with AngularJS,\nyou've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency\nInjection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level\nmodules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.\nIt can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces\nthe coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because\nit makes your code hard to refactor.\nAs stated previously, JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so the abstractions\nthat are depended upon are implicit contracts. That is to say, the methods\nand properties that an object\/class exposes to another object\/class. In the\nexample below, the implicit contract is that any Request module for an\nInventoryTracker will have a requestItems method.\nBad:\nclass InventoryRequester {\n  constructor() {\n    this.REQ_METHODS = [\"HTTP\"];\n  }\n\n  requestItem(item) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n}\n\nclass InventoryTracker {\n  constructor(items) {\n    this.items = items;\n\n    \/\/ BAD: We have created a dependency on a specific request implementation.\n    \/\/ We should just have requestItems depend on a request method: `request`\n    this.requester = new InventoryRequester();\n  }\n\n  requestItems() {\n    this.items.forEach(item => {\n      this.requester.requestItem(item);\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nconst inventoryTracker = new InventoryTracker([\"apples\", \"bananas\"]);\ninventoryTracker.requestItems();\nGood:\nclass InventoryTracker {\n  constructor(items, requester) {\n    this.items = items;\n    this.requester = requester;\n  }\n\n  requestItems() {\n    this.items.forEach(item => {\n      this.requester.requestItem(item);\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nclass InventoryRequesterV1 {\n  constructor() {\n    this.REQ_METHODS = [\"HTTP\"];\n  }\n\n  requestItem(item) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n}\n\nclass InventoryRequesterV2 {\n  constructor() {\n    this.REQ_METHODS = [\"WS\"];\n  }\n\n  requestItem(item) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n}\n\n\/\/ By constructing our dependencies externally and injecting them, we can easily\n\/\/ substitute our request module for a fancy new one that uses WebSockets.\nconst inventoryTracker = new InventoryTracker(\n  [\"apples\", \"bananas\"],\n  new InventoryRequesterV2()\n);\ninventoryTracker.requestItems();\n\u2b06 back to top\nTesting\nTesting is more important than shipping. If you have no tests or an\ninadequate amount, then every time you ship code you won't be sure that you\ndidn't break anything. Deciding on what constitutes an adequate amount is up\nto your team, but having 100% coverage (all statements and branches) is how\nyou achieve very high confidence and developer peace of mind. This means that\nin addition to having a great testing framework, you also need to use a\ngood coverage tool.\nThere's no excuse to not write tests. There are plenty of good JS test frameworks, so find one that your team prefers.\nWhen you find one that works for your team, then aim to always write tests\nfor every new feature\/module you introduce. If your preferred method is\nTest Driven Development (TDD), that is great, but the main point is to just\nmake sure you are reaching your coverage goals before launching any feature,\nor refactoring an existing one.\nSingle concept per test\nBad:\nimport assert from \"assert\";\n\ndescribe(\"MomentJS\", () => {\n  it(\"handles date boundaries\", () => {\n    let date;\n\n    date = new MomentJS(\"1\/1\/2015\");\n    date.addDays(30);\n    assert.equal(\"1\/31\/2015\", date);\n\n    date = new MomentJS(\"2\/1\/2016\");\n    date.addDays(28);\n    assert.equal(\"02\/29\/2016\", date);\n\n    date = new MomentJS(\"2\/1\/2015\");\n    date.addDays(28);\n    assert.equal(\"03\/01\/2015\", date);\n  });\n});\nGood:\nimport assert from \"assert\";\n\ndescribe(\"MomentJS\", () => {\n  it(\"handles 30-day months\", () => {\n    const date = new MomentJS(\"1\/1\/2015\");\n    date.addDays(30);\n    assert.equal(\"1\/31\/2015\", date);\n  });\n\n  it(\"handles leap year\", () => {\n    const date = new MomentJS(\"2\/1\/2016\");\n    date.addDays(28);\n    assert.equal(\"02\/29\/2016\", date);\n  });\n\n  it(\"handles non-leap year\", () => {\n    const date = new MomentJS(\"2\/1\/2015\");\n    date.addDays(28);\n    assert.equal(\"03\/01\/2015\", date);\n  });\n});\n\u2b06 back to top\nConcurrency\nUse Promises, not callbacks\nCallbacks aren't clean, and they cause excessive amounts of nesting.

in english.\n","40":"English | \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\nHacker Scripts\nBased on a true\nstory:\n\nxxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.\n\n\nxxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, \"legacy\"\n\n\nxxx: You're gonna love this\n\n\nxxx: smack-my-bitch-up.sh - sends a text message \"late at work\" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.\n\n\nxxx: kumar-asshole.sh - scans the inbox for emails from \"Kumar\" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like \"help\", \"trouble\", \"sorry\" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply \"no worries mate, be careful next time\".\n\n\nxxx: hangover.sh - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like \"not feeling well\/gonna work from home\" etc. Adds a random \"reason\" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.\n\n\nxxx: (and the oscar goes to) fucking-coffee.sh - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.\n\n\nxxx: holy sh*t I'm keeping those\n\nOriginal: http:\/\/bash.im\/quote\/436725 (in Russian)\nPull requests with other implementations (Python, Perl, Shell, etc) are welcome.\nUsage\nYou need these environment variables:\n# used in `smack-my-bitch-up` and `hangover` scripts\nTWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nTWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\n\n# used in `kumar_asshole` script\nGMAIL_USERNAME=admin@example.org\nGMAIL_PASSWORD=password\nFor Ruby scripts you need to install gems:\ngem install dotenv twilio-ruby gmail\nCron jobs\n# Runs `smack-my-bitch-up.sh` monday to friday at 9:20 pm.\n20 21 * * 1-5 \/path\/to\/scripts\/smack-my-bitch-up.sh >> \/path\/to\/smack-my-bitch-up.log 2>&1\n\n# Runs `hangover.sh` monday to friday at 8:45 am.\n45 8 * * 1-5 \/path\/to\/scripts\/hangover.sh >> \/path\/to\/hangover.log 2>&1\n\n# Runs `kumar-asshole.sh` every 10 minutes.\n*\/10 * * * * \/path\/to\/scripts\/kumar-asshole.sh\n\n# Runs `fucking-coffee.sh` hourly from 9am to 6pm on weekdays.\n0 9-18 * * 1-5 \/path\/to\/scripts\/fucking-coffee.sh\n\nCode is released under WTFPL.\n","41":"Awesome Mac\n  \n\n \n\uf8ff Now we have become very big, Different from the original idea.\nCollect premium software in various categories.

It's a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.\nLearn more at the Svelte website, or stop by the Discord chatroom.\nSupporting Svelte\nSvelte is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible entirely by the support of awesome volunteers. If you'd like to support their efforts, please consider:\n\nBecoming a backer on Open Collective.\n\nFunds donated via Open Collective will be used for compensating expenses related to Svelte's development such as hosting costs. If sufficient donations are received, funds may also be used to support Svelte's development more directly.\nDevelopment\nPull requests are encouraged and always welcome. Pick an issue and help us out!\nTo install and work on Svelte locally:\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/sveltejs\/svelte.git\ncd svelte\nnpm install\n\nDo not use Yarn to install the dependencies, as the specific package versions in package-lock.json are used to build and test Svelte.\n\nTo build the compiler, and all the other modules included in the package:\nnpm run build\nTo watch for changes and continually rebuild the package (this is useful if you're using npm link to test out changes in a project locally):\nnpm run dev\nThe compiler is written in TypeScript, but don't let that put you off \u2014 it's basically just JavaScript with type annotations. You'll pick it up in no time. If you're using an editor other than Visual Studio Code you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and code hints etc.\nRunning Tests\nnpm run test\nTo filter tests, use -g (aka --grep). For example, to only run tests involving transitions:\nnpm run test -- -g transition\nsvelte.dev\nThe source code for https:\/\/svelte.dev, including all the documentation, lives in the site directory. The site is built with Sapper.\nIs svelte.dev down?\nProbably not, but it's possible.

This means even faster installs.\nReliable: Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another system.\nSecure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.\nFeatures\n\nOffline Mode.

This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.\nThe Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.\nServerless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.\nWatch the video overview here.\nIn 2020, the Serverless Framework began introducing advanced functionality for specific serverless use-cases, known as Serverless Framework Components.

You can\nwrite native apps in HTML and JavaScript with NW.js. It also lets you\ncall Node.js modules directly from the DOM and enables a new way of writing\nnative applications with all Web technologies.\nIt was created in the Intel Open Source Technology Center.\nBuilding a Cross-platform Desktop App with NW.js\nCreating Desktop Applications With node-webkit\nWebApp to DesktopApp with node-webkit (slides)\nEssay on the history and internals of the project\nFeatures\n\nApps written in modern HTML5, CSS3, JS and WebGL.\nComplete support for Node.js APIs and all its third party modules.\nGood performance: Node and WebKit run in the same thread: Function calls are made straightforward; objects are in the same heap and can just reference each other.\nEasy to package and distribute apps.\nAvailable on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\n\nDownloads\n\n\nv0.50.0: (Nov 19, 2020, based off of Node.js v15.0.1, Chromium 87.0.4280.66) : release notes\nNOTE You might want the SDK build. Please read the release notes.\n\n\nLinux: 32bit \/ 64bit\n\n\nWindows: 32bit \/ 64bit\n\n\nMac 10.10+: 64bit\n\n\nUse Legacy build for Win XP and early OSX.\n\n\nlatest nightly build from git tip: https:\/\/dl.nwjs.io\/live-build\/\n\n\nPrevious versions; See the mapping file for the version info in previous releases.\n\n\nDemos and real apps\nYou may also be interested in our demos repository and the List of apps and companies using nw.js.\nQuick Start\nCreate index.html:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Hello World!<\/title>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello World!<\/h1>\n    We are using node.js <script>document.write(process.version)<\/script>.\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\nCreate package.json:\n{\n  \"name\": \"nw-demo\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\"\n}\nRun:\n$ \/path\/to\/nw .  (suppose the current directory contains 'package.json')\nNote: on Windows, you can drag the folder containing package.json to nw.exe to open it.\nNote: on OSX, the executable binary is in a hidden directory within the .app file. To run node-webkit on OSX, type:\n\/path\/to\/nwjs.app\/Contents\/MacOS\/nwjs . (suppose the current directory contains 'package.json')\nDocuments\nOfficial documentation: http:\/\/docs.nwjs.io\/\nFor more information on how to write\/package\/run apps, see:\n\nHow to run apps\nHow to package and distribute your apps\nHow to use Node.js modules in node-webkit\n\nAnd our Wiki for much more.\nCommunity\nWe use the google group as\nour mailing list (use English only). Subscribe via nwjs-general+subscribe@googlegroups.com.\nNOTE: Links to the old google group (e.g. https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!msg\/node-webkit\/doRWZ07LgWQ\/4fheV8FF8zsJ) that are no longer working can be fixed by replacing node-webkit with nwjs-general (e.g https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!msg\/nwjs-general\/doRWZ07LgWQ\/4fheV8FF8zsJ).\nIssues are being tracked here on GitHub.\nThe source code for NW.js and the daily development spans across multiple repositories in this organization. This repository is for the purpose of issue tracking, landing page and part of the source code.\nVerifying Binaries\nStarting from 0.32.0 the stable and nightly download directories contain a SHASUMS256.txt\nfile that lists the SHA checksums for each file available for download, as well as the\nchecksums for the files inside the download package.\nThe SHASUMS256.txt can be downloaded using curl.\n$ curl -O https:\/\/dl.nwjs.io\/vx.y.z\/SHASUMS256.txt\nTo check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run\nit through sha256sum with a command such as:\n$ grep nwjs-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c -\nThe stable releases (but not Nightlies) also have the GPG detached\nsignature of SHASUMS256.txt available as SHASUMS256.txt.asc. You can use gpg\nto verify that SHASUMS256.txt has not been tampered with.\nTo verify SHASUMS256.txt has not been altered, you will first need to import\nthe GPG key of NW.js maintainer to create releases.\nUse this command to import the key:\n$ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 78680FA9E21BB40A\n(Key fingerprint is 1E8B EE8D 5B0C 4CBC D6D1  9E26 7868 0FA9 E21B B40A)\n\nNext, download the SHASUMS256.txt.asc for the release:\n$ curl -O https:\/\/dl.nwjs.io\/vx.y.z\/SHASUMS256.txt.asc\nAfter downloading the appropriate SHASUMS256.txt and SHASUMS256.txt.asc files,\nyou can then use gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.asc SHASUMS256.txt to verify\nthat the file has been signed by an authorized member of the NW.js team.\nOnce verified, use the SHASUMS256.txt file to get the checksum for\nthe binary verification command above.\nLicense\nNW.js's code in this repo uses the MIT license, see our LICENSE file.

The actual (somewhat complete) documentation for Parcel 2 is available here: https:\/\/v2.parceljs.org\/.\n\nGetting Started\nBefore we get started, you'll need to install Node and Yarn (or npm) and create\na package.json for your project if you haven't already.\nyarn init\nThen with Yarn you can install parcel into your app:\nyarn add --dev parcel@next\nFrom there you just need to point Parcel at some of your entry files. Like if\nyou're building a website, an index.html file:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/>\n    <title>My First Parcel App<\/title>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, World!<\/h1>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\nNow if you just run:\nyarn parcel index.html\nYou should get a URL that looks something like: http:\/\/localhost:1234\/.\nNext you can start adding dependencies by specifying them in your code (however\nyour language specifies other assets). So for HTML we could create a\nstyles.css file next to our index.html file and include it with a <link>\ntag.\nh1 {\n  color: hotpink;\n  font-family: cursive;\n}\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/>\n    <title>My First Parcel App<\/title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\".\/styles.css\" \/>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, World!<\/h1>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\nIf we want parcel to update our changes in the browser without refreshing the page,\nwe need to add at least a dummy javascript file e.g. app.js next to our index.html.\nThis file allows parcel to inject all the necessary code to show your changes.\nThis file will later contain your javascript application.\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\");\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/>\n    <title>My First Parcel App<\/title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\".\/styles.css\" \/>\n    <script src=\".\/app.js\"><\/script>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, World!<\/h1>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\nDocumentation\n\nIntroduction\nParcel CLI\n\nCLI Args & Flags\n\nparcel serve\nparcel watch\nparcel build\n[...entries]\n--target [name]\n--open, -o [browser]\n--host <host>\n--port <port>, -p\n--https\n\n--cert <path>\n--key <path>\n\n\n--dist-dir <dir>\n--cache-dir <dir>, --no-cache\n--hot, --no-hot\n\n--hot-host <hostname>\n--hot-port <port>\n\n\n--[no-]source-maps\n--autoinstall [npm\/yarn], --no-autoinstall\n--log-level <level>\n--version, -v, -V\n--help, -h\n\n\n\n\nParcel Config\n\nConfiguring external tools\nConfiguring Parcel\npackage.json\n\npackage.json#name\npackage.json#version\npackage.json#main\npackage.json#module\npackage.json#browser\npackage.json#source\npackage.json#browserslist\npackage.json#engines\npackage.json#targets\npackage.json#alias\n\n\n.parcelrc\n\nGlob maps in .parcelrc\n.parcelrc#extends\n.parcelrc#resolvers\n.parcelrc#transformers\n.parcelrc#bundler\n.parcelrc#namers\n.parcelrc#runtimes\n.parcelrc#packagers\n.parcelrc#optimizers\n.parcelrc#reporters\n.parcelrc#validators\n\n\n\n\nParcel Architecture\n\nPhases of Parcel\nAsset Graph\nBundles\nSources\nTargets\n\nTarget Configuration\n\n\nEnvironments\nCaching\n\n\nAsset Resolution\n\nLocal Paths\nPackage Paths\nURLs\nTilde Paths\nAliases\n\n\nPlugins\n\nResolvers\nTransformers\nBundlers\nNamers\nRuntimes\nPackagers\nOptimizers\nReporters\nValidators\n\n\nCreating Plugins\n\nNaming\nVersioning\nEngines\n\n\nPlugin APIs\n\nResolvers\nTransformers\nBundler\nNamers\nRuntimes\nPackagers\nOptimizers\nReporters\nValidators\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nParcel is a compiler for all your code, regardless of the language or toolchain.\nParcel takes all of your files and dependencies, transforms them, and merges\nthem together into a smaller set of output files that can be used to run your\ncode.\nParcel supports many different languages and file types out of the box, from\nweb technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to lower level languages like\nRust, and anything that compiles to WebAssembly (WASM), to assets like images,\nfonts, videos, and more.\nParcel makes your code portable. You can build your code for different\nenvironments, for the web for your server, or for an app. You can even build\nmultiple targets at once and have them live update as you make changes.\nParcel is fast and predictable. It compiles all of your files in isolation in\nparallel inside workers, caching all of them as it goes along. Caches are\nstable across machines and are only affected by the files and configs within\nyour project (unless you want to pass specific environment variables).\nParcel CLI\nThe Parcel CLI is built into the main parcel package. While you can install\nit globally and run it, it is much better to install it locally into your\nproject as a dev dependency.\nyarn add --dev parcel@next\nYou should also add some \"scripts\" to your package.json to run it easier.\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-project\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"parcel build index.html\",\n    \"start\": \"parcel serve index.html\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"parcel\": \"latest\"\n  }\n}\nNow you can run yarn build to bundle your project for production and\nyarn start to dev on your project.\nCLI Args & Flags\nUsage:\n$ parcel [command] [...entries] [...flags]\nparcel serve\nServe assets on a local server.\nparcel watch\nWatch and rebuild code on file changes.\nparcel build\nBuild code once, in production mode.\n[...entries]\nEntry files to start bundling, these will be preserved as entry points in the\noutput. Defaults to package.json#source, falling back to src\/index.* or\nindex.*. See #Sources.\n--target [name]\nSpecifies a specific target to build. If unspecified, Parcel builds all\ntargets specified in package.json. See #Targets.\n--open, -o [browser]\nOpen your local server in a browser. You can optionally pass the name of the\nbrowser you want to open, otherwise it will use your default browser.\n--host <host>\nConfigure the host to serve assets on. The default is to listen on all interfaces.\n--port <port>, -p\nConfigure the port to serve assets on. Alternatively you can use the $PORT\nenvironment variable.\n--https\nThis will generate a local certificate (which will be untrusted by your\nbrowser, you'll need to approve it) and serve your assets over https:\/\/\n--cert <path>\nSpecify the filepath to your SSL certificate when using --https.\n--key <path>\nSpecify the filepath to your SSL key when using --https.\n--dist-dir <dir>\nConfigure the directory where compiled assets are output. Default is .\/dist.\n--cache-dir <dir>, --no-cache\nConfigure the cache directory with --cache <dir> or disable it altogether\nwith --no-cache.\n--hot, --no-hot\nTurn hot reloading on or off.\n--hot-host <hostname>\nConfigure the hot reloading hostname.\n--hot-port <port>\nConfigure the hot reloading port.\n--[no-]source-maps\nTurn source maps on or off. Source maps are turned on by default.\n--autoinstall [npm\/yarn], --no-autoinstall\nWhen enabled, whenever Parcel discovers a dependency that isn't installed it\nwill attempt to install it with either npm or Yarn (defaults to npm unless a\nyarn.lock exists).\n--log-level <level>\nSet the log level, either either \"none\", \"error\", \"warn\", \"info\", or \"verbose\".\nThe default is \"info\".\n--version, -v, -V\nReturn the current version of Parcel.\n--help, -h\nGet help with the CLI.\nParcel Config\nParcel has always and will always work out of the box for many projects with\nzero configuration. It should always be extremely simple to get started. But if\nyou do want more control, we give you the tools to do so.\nConfiguring external tools\nA huge part of what Parcel does is run other tools over your code. Instead of\npulling all that configuration into Parcel, we make use of their own\nconfiguration systems. So if you're using Babel, you should just use .babelrc\nfiles to configure it.\nWhen we do need to introduce config, we create tool specific config files in\norder to do so.\nConfiguring Parcel\nWhen you do need to configure Parcel, it will be in one of 3 places.\n\nIf you need to configure the CLI, it will be a CLI flag\nIf you need to configure your package, it will be in the package.json\nIf you need to configure something with your files or the Parcel asset\npipeline, it will be in .parcelrc\n\npackage.json\n[todo]\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"main\": \"dist\/main\/index.js\",\n  \"module\": \"dist\/module\/index.js\",\n  \"browser\": \"dist\/browser\/index.js\",\n  \"browserslist\": [\"> 1%\", \"not dead\"],\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \">=4.x\"\n  },\n  \"source\": \"src\/index.js\",\n  \"targets\": {\n    \"main\": {\n      \"engines\": {\n        \"node\": \">=4.x\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"module\": {\n      \"engines\": {\n        \"node\": \">=8.x\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"browser\": {\n      \"engines\": {\n        \"browsers\": [\"> 1%\", \"not dead\"]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"alias\": {\n    \"react\": \"preact-compat\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"preact-compat\"\n  }\n}\npackage.json#name\n(Required) The name of the package is always required in order to be\nconsidered a valid package.json.\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-package\"\n}\npackage.json#version\n(Required) All packages inside node_modules must have a package.json#version.\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\npackage.json#main\nThis is the \"main\" target's entry point for the package, by default in library mode (doesn't bundle dependencies).\n{\n  \"main\": \"dist\/main\/index.js\"\n}\nSee Targets\npackage.json#module\nThis is the \"module\" target's entry point for the package, by default in library mode (doesn't bundle dependencies).\n{\n  \"module\": \"dist\/module\/index.js\"\n}\nSee Targets\npackage.json#browser\nThis is the \"browser\" target's entry point for the package, by default in library mode (doesn't bundle dependencies).\n{\n  \"browser\": \"dist\/browser\/index.js\"\n}\nSee Targets\npackage.json#source\nSpecify the entry points for your source code which gets mapped to your\ntargets.\n{\n  \"source\": \"src\/index.js\",\n  \"source\": [\"src\/index.js\", \"src\/index.html\"]\n}\nSee Sources\npackage.json#browserslist\nAs specified by Browserslist, this field is for specifying which transformers\nshould be applied to browser bundles.\n{\n  \"browserslist\": [\"> 0.2%\", \"not dead\"]\n}\nSee Environments\npackage.json#engines\nSpecify what versions of what engines you want to support.\n{\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \">=4.x\",\n    \"electron\": \">=2.x\"\n  }\n}\nSee Environments\npackage.json#targets\nConfiguration for individual targets.\n{\n  \"targets\": {\n    \"main\": {\n      \"engines\": {\n        \"node\": \">=4.x\",\n        \"electron\": \">=2.x\"\n      },\n    },\n    \"browser\": {\n      \"engines\": {\n        \"browsers\": [\"> 1%\", \"not dead\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nSee Targets\npackage.json#alias\nAliases asset names\/paths to other assets.\n{\n  \"alias\": {\n    \"react\": \"preact-compat\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"preact-compat\"\n  }\n}\nSee Aliases\n.parcelrc\nYour .parcelrc file will likely contain just a few fields (if you have one at\nall), but here's an example of a .parcelrc file that contains every field:\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"@parcel\/config-default\"],\n  \"resolvers\": [\"@parcel\/resolver-default\"],\n  \"transformers\": {\n    \"*.vue\": [\"@parcel\/transformer-vue\"],\n    \"*.scss\": [\"@parcel\/transformer-sass\"],\n    \"*.js\": [\"@parcel\/transformer-babel\"],\n    \"*.css\": [\"@parcel\/transformer-postcss\"],\n    \"*.html\": [\"@parcel\/transformer-posthtml\"]\n  },\n  \"bundler\": \"@parcel\/bundler-default\",\n  \"namers\": [\"@parcel\/namer-default\"],\n  \"runtimes\": {\n    \"browser\": [\"@parcel\/runtime-js\", \"@parcel\/runtime-browser-hmr\"],\n    \"node\": [\"@parcel\/runtime-js\"]\n  },\n  \"packagers\": {\n    \"*.js\": \"@parcel\/packager-js\",\n    \"*.css\": \"@parcel\/packager-css\",\n    \"*.html\": \"@parcel\/packager-html\",\n    \"*.wasm\": \"@parcel\/packager-wasm\",\n    \"*.raw\": \"@parcel\/packager-raw\"\n  },\n  \"optimizers\": {\n    \"*.js\": [\"@parcel\/optimizer-uglify\"],\n    \"*.css\": [\"@parcel\/optimizer-cssnano\"],\n    \"*.html\": [\"@parcel\/optimizer-htmlnano\"],\n    \"*.{png,jpg,jpeg,svg,...}\": [\"@parcel\/optimizer-imagemin\"]\n  },\n  \"reporters\": [\"@parcel\/reporter-cli\"]\n}\nGlob maps in .parcelrc\nMany config properties like transformers or packagers use objects as maps of\nglobs to package names. While objects in JSON are technically unordered, Parcel\ndoes use the order to give globs priority when a file name is being tested\nagainst them.\n{\n  \"transformers\": {\n    \"icons\/*.svg\": [\"highest-priority\"],\n    \"*.svg\": [\"lowest-priority\"]\n  }\n}\nHere if we are trying to find a transform for the file icons\/home.svg, we'll\nwork our way down the globs until we find a match, which would be\nicons\/*.svg, we never reach *.svg.\n.parcelrc#extends\nextends can either be a string or an array of strings that specify base\nconfigs to extend. That base configuration can be the path to another\n.parcelrc file or the name of a Parcel config package.\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@parcel\/config-default\",\n  \"extends\": \"..\/.parcelrc\",\n  \"extends\": [\"@parcel\/config-default\", \"@company\/parcel-config\"]\n}\nWhen extending a config, Parcel does a shallow merge of the two configs.\n.parcelrc#resolvers\nresolvers is an array of strings that specifies the name of a Parcel resolver\npackage.\n{\n  \"resolvers\": [\"@parcel\/resolver-default\"]\n}\nSee Resolvers\n.parcelrc#transformers\ntransformers is an object map of globs to arrays of Parcel transform packages.\n{\n  \"transformers\": {\n    \"*.js\": [\"@parcel\/transformer-babel\"]\n  }\n}\nSee Transformers\n.parcelrc#bundler\nbundler is a string that specifies the name of a Parcel bundler package.\n{\n  \"bundler\": \"@parcel\/bundler-default\"\n}\nSee Bundlers\n.parcelrc#namers\nnamers is an array of Parcel namer packages.\n{\n  \"namers\": [\"@parcel\/namer-default\"]\n}\nSee Namers\n.parcelrc#runtimes\nruntimes is an object map of environments to arrays of Parcel runtime packages.\n{\n  \"runtimes\": {\n    \"browser\": [\"@parcel\/runtime-js\", \"@parcel\/runtime-browser-hmr\"],\n    \"node\": [\"@parcel\/runtime-js\"]\n  }\n}\nSee Runtimes\n.parcelrc#packagers\npackagers is an object map of globs to Parcel packager packages.\n{\n  \"packagers\": {\n    \"*.js\": [\"@parcel\/packager-js\"]\n  }\n}\nSee Packagers\n.parcelrc#optimizers\noptimizers is an object map of globs to arrays of Parcel optimizer packages.\n{\n  \"optimizers\": {\n    \"*.js\": [\"@parcel\/optimizer-uglify\"]\n  }\n}\nSee Optimizers\n.parcelrc#reporters\nreporters is an array of Parcel reporter packages.\n{\n  \"reporters\": [\"@parcel\/reporter-detailed\"]\n}\nSee Reporters.\n.parcelrc#validators\nvalidators is an object map of globs to arrays of Parcel validator packages.\n  \"validators\": {\n    \"*.ts\": [\"@parcel\/validator-typescript\"]\n  }\n}\nSee Validators.\nParcel Architecture\nEven if you aren't doing anything that complex, if you are going to use Parcel\na lot it makes sense to take some time and understand how it works.\nPhases of Parcel\nAt a high level Parcel runs through several phases:\n\nResolving\nTransforming\nBundling\nPackaging\nOptimizing\n(Validating)\n\nThe resolving and transforming phases work together in parallel to\nbuild a graph of all your assets.\nThis asset graph gets translated into bundles in the bundling phase.\nThen the packaging phase takes the assets in the calculated bundles and\nmerges them together into files each containing an entire bundle.\nFinally, in the optimizing phase, Parcel takes these bundles files and runs\nthem through optimizing transforms.\nAsset Graph\nDuring the resolving and transforming phases, Parcel discovers all the assets\nin your app or program. Every asset can have its own dependencies on other\nassets which Parcel will pull in.\nThe data structure that represents all of these assets and their dependencies\non one another is known as \"The Asset Graph\".\n\n\n\nAsset Name\nDependencies\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\napp.css, app.js\n\n\napp.css\nN\/A\n\n\napp.js\nnavbar.js\n\n\nnavbar.js\netc.\n\n\n\nBundles\nOnce Parcel has built the entire Asset Graph, it begins turning it into\n\"bundles\". These bundles are groupings of assets that get placed together in a\nsingle file.\nBundles will (generally) contain only assets in the same language:\n\n\n\nBundle Name\nAssets\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\nindex.html\n\n\napp.css\napp.css\n\n\napp.js\napp.js, navbar.js, etc.\n\n\n\nSome assets are considered \"entry\" points into your app, and will stay as\nseparate bundles. For example, if your index.html file links to an\nabout.html file, they won't be merged together.\n\n\n\nBundle Name\nAssets\nEntry URL\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\nindex.html\n\/\n\n\nabout.html\nabout.html\n\/about\n\n\n\nSources\n\"Sources\" are the files that contain the source code to your app before being\ncompiled by Parcel.\nParcel discovers these sources by following their dependencies on one another\nstarting at your \"entries\".\nThese entries will be one of:\n\n$ parcel <...entries>\n~\/package.json#source\n.\/src\/index.*\n.\/index.*\n\nFrom there, everything those assets depend on will be considered a \"source\" in\nParcel.\nTargets\nWhen Parcel runs, it can build your asset graph in multiple different ways\nsimultaneously. These are called \"targets\".\nFor example, you could have a \"modern\" target that targets newer browsers\nand a \"legacy\" target for older browsers.\nSources get mapped to targets,\nTarget Configuration\nIn the most explicit form, targets are configured via the\npackage.json#targets field.\n{\n  \"app\": \"dist\/browser\/index.js\",\n  \"appModern\": \"dist\/browserModern\/index.js\",\n  \"targets\": {\n    \"app\": { \/* target env *\/ },\n    \"appModern\": { \/* target env *\/ }\n  }\n}\nEach target has a name which corresponds to a top-level package.json field\nsuch as package.json#main or package.json#browser which specify the primary\nentry point for that target.\nInside each of those targets contains the target's environment configuration:\n\n\n\nOption\nPossible values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncontext\n'node' | 'browser' | 'web-worker' | 'electron-main' | 'electron-renderer'\nWhere the bundle should run\n\n\nincludeNodeModules\nboolean | [String]\nWhether to bundle all\/none\/some node_module dependency\n\n\noutputFormat\n'global' | 'esmodule' | 'commonjs'\nWhich type of imports\/exports should be emitted\n\n\npublicUrl\nstring\nThe public url of the bundle at runtime\n\n\nisLibrary\nboolean\nLibrary as in 'npm library'\n\n\nsourceMap\nboolean | {inlineSources?: boolean, sourceRoot?: string, inline?: boolean}\nEnable\/disable sourcemap and set options\n\n\nengines\nEngines\nSame as package.json#engines\n\n\n\nHowever, a lot of the normal configuration you might want will already have\ndefaults provided for you:\ntargets = {\n  main: {\n    engines: {\n      node: value(\"package.json#engines.node\"),\n      browsers: unless exists(\"package.json#browser\") then value(\"package.json#browserlist\")\n    },\n    isLibrary: true\n  },\n  module: {\n    engines: {\n      node: value(\"package.json#engines.node\"),\n      browsers: unless exists(\"package.json#browser\") then value(\"package.json#browserlist\")\n    },\n    isLibrary: true\n  },\n  browser: {\n    engines: {\n      browsers: value(\"package.json#browserslist\")\n    },\n    isLibrary: true\n  },\n  ...value(\"package.json#targets\"),\n}\nEnvironments\nEnvironments tell Parcel how to transform and bundle each asset. They tell\nParcel if an asset is going to be run in a browser or in NodeJS\/Electron.\nThey also tell Parcel's transform plugins how they should run.

If someone made a better version of your plugin, please consider\ngiving the better package name over, have them make a major version bump, and\nredirect people to the new tool.\nVersioning\nYou must follow semantic versioning (to the best of your ability). No, it's not\nthe perfect system, but it's the best one we have and people do depend on it.\nIf plugin authors intentionally don't follow semantic versioning, Parcel may\nstart warning users that they should be locking down the version number for\nyour plugin.\n\nWarning: The plugin \"parcel-transform-typescript\" does not follow semantic\nversioning. You should lock the version range down so your code does not\nbreak when they make changes. Please upvote this issue to encourage them to\nfollow semver: https:\/\/github.com\/user\/parcel-transform-typescript\/issues\/43\n\nEngines\nYou must specify a package.json#engines.parcel field with the version range\nof Parcel that your plugin supports:\n{\n  \"name\": \"parcel-transform-imagemin\",\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"parcel\": \"2.x\"\n  }\n}\nIf you do not specify this field, Parcel will output a warning:\nWarning: The plugin \"parcel-transform-typescript\" needs to specify a `package.json#engines.parcel` field with the supported Parcel version range.\n\nIf you do specify the parcel engine field and the user is using an incompatible\nversion of Parcel, they will see an error:\nError: The plugin \"parcel-transform-typescript\" is not compatible with the\ncurrent version of Parcel. Requires \"2.x\" but the current version is \"3.1.4\"\n\nParcel uses node-semver to match version ranges.\nPlugin APIs\nThere are several different types of plugins. They all look very similar, but\nare kept separate so we can have strict contracts one what each one is allowed\nto do.\nThere are some rules that should be followed across every type of plugin:\n\nStateless \u2014 Avoid any kind of state, it will likely be the source of bugs\nfor your users. For example, the same transform may exist in multiple\nseparate workers which are not allowed to communicate with one another, state\nwill not work as expected.\nPure \u2014 Given the same input, a plugin must produce the same output, and\nyou must not have any observable side effects, or implicit dependencies.\nOtherwise Parcel's caching will break and your users will be sad. You should\nnever have to tell users to delete their caches.\n\nThe plugin APIs all follow a common shape:\nimport {NameOfPluginType} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new NameOfPluginType({\n  async methodName(opts: JSONObject): Promise<JSONObject> {\n    return result;\n  }\n});\nThey are made up of modules with well-known named exports of async functions\nthat:\n\nAccept a strictly validated JSON-serializable opts object.\nReturn a strictly validated JSON-serializable vals object.\n\nIf something you need is not being passed through opts, please come talk to\nthe Parcel team about it. Avoid trying to get information yourself from other\nsources, especially from the file system.\nResolvers\nResolvers get called with an asset request (consisting of a source file path\nand the specifier of what is being requested) which it then attempts to\nresolve. If the resolver isn't sure how to handle a request, it can also return\nnull and pass it to the next resolver in the chain.\nimport {Resolver} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Resolver({\n  async resolve({dependency}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return {filePath} || null;\n  }\n});\nTransformers\nTransformers transform single assets as they are discovered and added to the\nasset graph. They mostly call out to different compilers and preprocessors.\nimport {Transform} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Transform({\n  async parse({asset}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return ast;\n  },\n\n  async transform({asset}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return [assets];\n  },\n\n  async generate({asset}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return {code, map};\n  }\n});\nBundler\nBundlers accept the entire asset graph and modify it to add bundle nodes that group the assets\ninto output bundles.\nimport {Bundler} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Bundler({\n  async bundle({graph}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  },\n\n  async optimize({graph}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n});\nNamers\nNamers accept a bundle and output a filename for that bundle.\nimport {Namer} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Namer({\n  async name({bundle, bundleGraph}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return name;\n  }\n});\nRuntimes\nRuntimes accept a bundle and return assets to be inserted into that bundle.\nimport {Runtime} from '@parcel\/runtime';\n\nexport default new Runtime({\n  async apply({bundle, bundleGraph}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return assets;\n  }\n});\nPackagers\nPackagers determine how to merge different asset types into a single bundle.\nimport {Packager} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Packager({\n  async package({bundle}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return {contents, map};\n  },\n});\nOptimizers\nOptimizers are similar to transformers, but they accept a bundle instead\nof a single asset.\nimport {Optimizer} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Optimizer({\n  async optimize({bundle, contents, map}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    return {contents, map};\n  }\n});\nReporters\nReporters receive events as they happen and can output to stdout\/stderr,\nor perform other actions.\nimport {Reporter} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Reporter({\n  async report({ event: { type, ... } }) {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n});\nValidators\nValidators receive an asset, and can throw errors if that asset is invalid\nin some way, e.g. type errors or linting errors.\nimport {Validator} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Validator({\n  async validate({asset}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    throw error;\n  }\n});\nSome validators (such as @parcel\/validator-typescript) may wish to maintain a project-wide cache for efficiency. For these cases, it is appropriate to use a different interface where parcel hands all changed files to the validator at the same time:\nimport {Validator} from '@parcel\/plugin';\n\nexport default new Validator({\n  async validateAll({assets}) {\n    \/\/ ...\n    throw error;\n  }\n});\nIf your plugin implements validateAll, Parcel will make sure to always invoke this method on the same thread (so that your cache state is accessible).\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details\n","52":"Introduction\n\n\n\nAdminLTE is a fully responsive administration template.

For more information about styling you can look into CSS code which shows how classes provided by impress.js can be used. Last but not least JavaScript code of impress.js has some useful comments if you are interested in how everything works. Feel free to explore!\nOfficial demo\nimpress.js demo by @bartaz\nExamples and demos\nThe Classic Slides demo is targeted towards beginners, or can be used as a template for presentations that look like the traditional PowerPoint slide deck. Over time, it also grew into the example presentation that uses most of the features and addons available.\nMore examples and demos can be found on Examples and demos wiki page.\nFeel free to add your own example presentations (or websites) there.\nOther tutorials and learning resources\nIf you want to learn even more there is a list of tutorials and other learning resources\non the wiki, too.\nThere is also a book available about Building impressive presentations with impress.js by Rakhitha Nimesh Ratnayake.\nYou may want to check out the sibling project Impressionist: a 3D GUI editor that can help you in creating impress.js presentations.\nMailing list\nYou're welcome to ask impress.js related questions on the impressionist-presentations mailing list.\nREPOSITORY STRUCTURE\n\nindex.html: This is the official impress.js demo, showcasing all of the features of the original impress.js, as well as some new plugins as we add them.\n\nAs already mentioned, this file is well commented and acts as the official tutorial.\n\n\nexamples\/: Contains several demos showcasing additional features available.\n\nClassic Slides is a simple demo that you can use as template if you want to create very simple, rectangular, PowerPoint-like presentations.\n\n\nsrc\/: The main file is src\/impress.js. Additional functionality is implemented as plugins in src\/plugins\/.\n\nSee src\/plugins\/README.md for information about the plugin API and how to write plugins.\n\n\ntest\/: Contains QUnit and Syn libraries that we use for writing tests, as well as some test coverage for core functionality. (Yes, more tests are much welcome.) Tests for plugins are in the directory of each plugin.\njs\/: Contains js\/impress.js, which contains a concatenation of the core src\/impress.js and all the plugins. Traditionally this is the file that you'll link to in a browser. In fact both the demo and test files do exactly that.\ncss\/: Contains a CSS file used by the demo. This file is not required for using impress.js in your own presentations. Impress.js creates the CSS it needs dynamically.\nextras\/ contains plugins that for various reasons aren't enabled by default. You have to explicitly add them with their own script element to use them.\nbuild.js: Simple build file that creates js\/impress.js. It also creates a minified version impress.min.js, but that one is not included in the github repository.\npackage.json: An NPM package specification. This was mainly added so you can easily install buildify and run node build.js. Other than the build process, which is really just doing roughly cat src\/impress.js src\/plugins\/*\/*.js > js\/impress.js, and testing, impress.js itself doesn't depend on Node or any NPM modules.\n\nWANT TO CONTRIBUTE?\nFor developers, once you've made changes to the code, you should run these commands for testing:\nnpm install\nnpm run all\n\nNote that running firefox qunit_test_runner.html is usually more informative than running karma with npm run test. They both run the same tests.\nMore info about the src\/ directory can be found in src\/plugins\/README.md.\nRequirements\n\n>= node 7.6\nnpm\n\nABOUT THE NAME\nimpress.js name is courtesy of @skuzniak.\nIt's an (un)fortunate coincidence that a Open\/LibreOffice presentation tool is called Impress ;)\nReference API\nSee the Reference API\nBROWSER SUPPORT\nThe design goal for impress.js has been to showcase awesome CSS3 features as found in modern browser versions. We also use some new DOM functionality, and specifically do not use jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, nor our own functions, to support older browsers. In general, recent versions of Firefox and Chrome are known to work well. Reportedly IE now works too.\nThe typical use case for impress.js is to create presentations that you present from your own laptop, with a browser version you know works well. Some people also use impress.js successfully to embed animations or presentations in a web page, however, be aware that in this some of your visitors may not see the presentation correctly, or at all.\nIn particular, impress.js makes use of the following JS and CSS features:\n\nDataSet API\nClassList API\nCSS 3D Transforms\nCSS Transitions\n\nCOPYRIGHT AND LICENSE\nCopyright 2011-2016 Bartek Szopka\nCopyright 2015-2017 Henrik Ingo\nReleased under the MIT License\n","54":"\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost.org |\n    Features |\n    Showcase |\n    Forum |\n    Docs |\n    Contributing |\n    Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove open source?

It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.\nStarting an application in production mode is as easy as:\n$ pm2 start app.js\nPM2 is constantly assailed by more than 1800 tests.\nOfficial website: https:\/\/pm2.keymetrics.io\/\nWorks on Linux (stable) & macOS (stable) & Windows (stable). All Node.js versions are supported starting Node.js 8.X.\nInstalling PM2\nWith NPM:\n$ npm install pm2 -g\nOr if you don't have Node.js installed:\nwget -qO- https:\/\/getpm2.com\/install.sh | bash\nStart an application\nYou can start any application (Node.js, Python, Ruby, binaries in $PATH...) like that:\n$ pm2 start app.js\nYour app is now daemonized, monitored and kept alive forever.\nManaging Applications\nOnce applications are started you can manage them easily:\n\nTo list all running applications:\n$ pm2 list\nManaging apps is straightforward:\n$ pm2 stop     <app_name|namespace|id|'all'|json_conf>\n$ pm2 restart  <app_name|namespace|id|'all'|json_conf>\n$ pm2 delete   <app_name|namespace|id|'all'|json_conf>\nTo have more details on a specific application:\n$ pm2 describe <id|app_name>\nTo monitor logs, custom metrics, application information:\n$ pm2 monit\nMore about Process Management\nCluster Mode: Node.js Load Balancing & Zero Downtime Reload\nThe Cluster mode is a special mode when starting a Node.js application, it starts multiple processes and load-balance HTTP\/TCP\/UDP queries between them. This increase overall performance (by a factor of x10 on 16 cores machines) and reliability (faster socket re-balancing in case of unhandled errors).\nStarting a Node.js application in cluster mode that will leverage all CPUs available:\n$ pm2 start api.js -i <processes>\n<processes> can be 'max', -1 (all cpu minus 1) or a specified number of instances to start.\nZero Downtime Reload\nHot Reload allows to update an application without any downtime:\n$ pm2 reload all\nSeamlessly supported by all major Node.js frameworks and any Node.js applications without any code change:\n\nMore informations about how PM2 make clustering easy\nContainer Support\nWith the drop-in replacement command for node, called pm2-runtime, run your Node.js application in a hardened production environment.\nUsing it is seamless:\nRUN npm install pm2 -g\nCMD [ \"pm2-runtime\", \"npm\", \"--\", \"start\" ]\n\nRead More about the dedicated integration\nTerminal Based Monitoring\n\nMonitor all processes launched straight from the command line:\n$ pm2 monit\nLog Management\nTo consult logs just type the command:\n$ pm2 logs\nStandard, Raw, JSON and formated output are available.\nExamples:\n$ pm2 logs APP-NAME       # Display APP-NAME logs\n$ pm2 logs --json         # JSON output\n$ pm2 logs --format       # Formated output\n\n$ pm2 flush               # Flush all logs\n$ pm2 reloadLogs          # Reload all logs\nMore about log management\nStartup Scripts Generation\nPM2 can generates and configure a Startup Script to keep PM2 and your processes alive at every server restart.\nInit Systems Supported: systemd, upstart, launchd, rc.d\n# Generate Startup Script\n$ pm2 startup\n\n# Freeze your process list across server restart\n$ pm2 save\n\n# Remove Startup Script\n$ pm2 unstartup\nMore about Startup Scripts Generation\nPM2 Modules\nPM2 embeds a simple and powerful module system. Installing a module is straightforward:\n$ pm2 install <module_name>\nHere are some PM2 compatible modules (standalone Node.js applications managed by PM2):\npm2-logrotate automatically rotate logs and limit logs size\npm2-server-monit monitor the current server with more than 20+ metrics and 8 actions\nUpdating PM2\n# Install latest PM2 version\n$ npm install pm2@latest -g\n# Save process list, exit old PM2 & restore all processes\n$ pm2 update\nPM2 updates are seamless\nPM2+ Monitoring\nIf you manage your apps with PM2, PM2+ makes it easy to monitor and manage apps across servers.\n\nFeel free to try it:\nDiscover the monitoring dashboard for PM2\nThanks in advance and we hope that you like PM2!\nCHANGELOG\nCHANGELOG\nContributors\nContributors\nLicense\nPM2 is made available under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0 (AGPL 3.0).\nFor other licenses contact us.\n","57":"PDF.js \nPDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.\nPDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to\ncreate a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and\nrendering PDFs.\nContributing\nPDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To\nget involved, visit:\n\nIssue Reporting Guide\nCode Contribution Guide\nFrequently Asked Questions\nGood Beginner Bugs\nProjects\n\nFeel free to stop by our Matrix room for questions or guidance.\nGetting Started\nOnline demo\nPlease note that the \"Modern browsers\" version assumes native support for\nfeatures such as e.g. async\/await, and ReadableStream.\n\n\nModern browsers: https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/pdf.js\/web\/viewer.html\n\n\nOlder browsers: https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/pdf.js\/es5\/web\/viewer.html\n\n\nBrowser Extensions\nFirefox\nPDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.\nChrome\n\nThe official extension for Chrome can be installed from the Chrome Web Store.\nThis extension is maintained by @Rob--W.\nBuild Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue gulp chromium. Then open\nChrome, go to Tools > Extension and load the (unpackaged) extension from the\ndirectory build\/chromium.\n\nGetting the Code\nTo get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:\n$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/mozilla\/pdf.js.git\n$ cd pdf.js\n\nNext, install Node.js via the official package or via\nnvm. You need to install the gulp package\nglobally (see also gulp's getting started):\n$ npm install -g gulp-cli\n\nIf everything worked out, install all dependencies for PDF.js:\n$ npm install\n\nFinally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening\nPDF files using a file:\/\/ URL. Run:\n$ gulp server\n\nand then you can open:\n\nhttp:\/\/localhost:8888\/web\/viewer.html\n\nPlease keep in mind that this requires an ES6 compatible browser; refer to Building PDF.js for usage with older browsers.\nIt is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:\n\nhttp:\/\/localhost:8888\/test\/pdfs\/?frame\n\nBuilding PDF.js\nIn order to bundle all src\/ files into two production scripts and build the generic\nviewer, run:\n$ gulp generic\n\nThis will generate pdf.js and pdf.worker.js in the build\/generic\/build\/ directory.\nBoth scripts are needed but only pdf.js needs to be included since pdf.worker.js will\nbe loaded by pdf.js. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.\nUsing PDF.js in a web application\nTo use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library\nor to build it from source.

The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.\n\nDoc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.\n\nDiagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly.\nBut not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning. \nMermaid addresses this problem by cutting the time, effort and tooling that is required to create modifiable diagrams and charts, for smarter and more reusable content.\nThe text definitions for Mermaid diagrams allows for it to be updated easily, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).\nSo less time needs be spent on documenting, as a separate and laborious task. \nEven non-programmers can create diagrams through the Mermaid Live Editor.\nTutorials has video tutorials.\nUse Mermaid with your favorite applications, check out the list of Integrations and Usages of Mermaid.\nFor a more detailed introduction to Mermaid and some of its more basic uses, look to the Beginner's Guide and Usage.\n\ud83c\udf10 CDN | \ud83d\udcd6 Documentation | \ud83d\ude4c Contribution | \ud83d\udcdc Changelog\nExamples\nThe following are some examples of the diagrams, charts and graphs that can be made using Mermaid and the Markdown-inspired text specific to it.

Instead of cluttering up your coding\nenvironment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts\ncontext-specific code and tools inline.\nBrackets is in sync with your browser. With Live Preview, Brackets\nworks directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump\nback and forth between your real source code and the browser view.\nDo it yourself. Because Brackets is open source, and built with HTML, CSS\nand JavaScript, you can help build the best code editor for the web.\n\nBrackets may have reached version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our\ntrello board that we're anxious to add and other\ninnovative web development workflows that we're planning to build into Brackets.\nSo take Brackets out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite editor.\nYou can see some\nscreenshots of Brackets\non the wiki, intro videos on YouTube, and news on the Brackets blog.\nHow to install and run Brackets\nDownload\nInstallers for the latest stable build for Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian\/Ubuntu) can be downloaded here.\nUsage\nBy default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple \"Getting Started\" content.\nYou can choose a different folder to edit using File > Open Folder.\nMost of Brackets should be pretty self-explanatory, but for information on how\nto use its unique features, like Quick Edit and Live Preview, please read\nHow to Use Brackets.\nAlso, see the release notes\nfor a list of new features and known issues in each build.\nIn addition to the core features built into Brackets, there is a large and growing\ncommunity of developers building extensions that add all sorts of useful functionality.\nSee the Brackets Extension Registry\nfor a list of available extensions. For installation instructions,\nsee the extensions wiki page.\nNeed help?\nHaving problems starting Brackets the first time, or not sure how to use Brackets?  Please\nreview Troubleshooting, which helps\nyou to fix common problems and find extra help if needed.\nHelping Brackets\nI found a bug!\nIf you found a repeatable bug, and troubleshooting\ntips didn't help, then be sure to search existing issues first.\nInclude steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, and your OS and\nBrackets version number. Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.\nRead more guidelines for filing good bugs.\nI have a new suggestion, but don't know how to program!\nFor feature requests please first check our Trello board to\nsee if it's already there; you can upvote it if so. If not, feel free to file it as an issue as above; we'll\nmove it to the feature backlog for you.\nI want to help with the code!\nAwesome! There are lots of ways you can help. First read\nCONTRIBUTING.md,\nthen learn how to pull the repo and hack on Brackets.\nThe text editor inside Brackets is based on\nCodeMirror\u2014thanks to Marijn for\ntaking our pull requests, implementing feature requests and fixing bugs! See\nNotes on CodeMirror\nfor info on how we're using CodeMirror.\nAlthough Brackets is built in HTML\/CSS\/JS, it currently runs as a desktop\napplication in a thin native shell, so that it can access your local files.\n(If you just try to open the index.html file in a browser, it won't work yet.)\nThe native shell for Brackets lives in a separate repo,\nadobe\/brackets-shell.\nI want to keep track of how Brackets is doing!\nNot sure you needed the exclamation point there, but we like your enthusiasm.\nWhat's Brackets working on next?\n\nIn our feature backlog, the columns to the right\n(starting from \"Development\") list the features that we're currently working on.\n\"Ready\" shows what we'll be working on next.\nWatch our GitHub activity stream.\nWatch our Waffle Kanban board: Work items in  are next.

A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then\ncan other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as Sign in with Facebook\nauthentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.\nWhen I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.\nI also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,\nwithout being too specific. In the worst case, you can use this as a learning guide for your projects,\nif for example you are only interested in Sign in with Google authentication and nothing else.\nTestimonials\n\n\u201cNice!

Alternatively,\nhere is another great tutorial for complete beginners - Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB.\nGetting Started\nThe easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:\n# Get the latest snapshot\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/sahat\/hackathon-starter.git myproject\n\n# Change directory\ncd myproject\n\n# Install NPM dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Then simply start your app\nnode app.js\nWarning: If you want to use some API that need https to work (for example Pinterest or facebook),\nyou will need to download ngrok.\nYou must start ngrok after starting the project.\n# start ngrok to intercept the data exchanged on port 8080\n.\/ngrok http 8080\nNext, you must use the https URL defined by ngrok, for example, https:\/\/hackaton.ngrok.io\nNote: I highly recommend installing Nodemon.\nIt watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the\nserver. Once installed, instead of node app.js use nodemon app.js. It will\nsave you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually\nrestart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run\nsudo npm install -g nodemon.\nObtaining API Keys\nTo use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need\nto obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or\nUsername & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new\ncredentials.\n\n\nVisit Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console\nEnter your application's name as the Label\nChose reCAPTCHA v2, \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox\nEnter localhost as the domain.  You can have other domains added in addition to localhost\nAccept the terms and submit the form\nCopy the Site Key and the Secret key into .env.  These keys will be accessible under Settings, reCAPTCHA keys drop down if you need them again later.\n\n\n\n\nVisit Google Cloud Console\nClick on the Create Project button\nEnter Project Name, then click on Create button\nThen click on APIs & auth in the sidebar and select API tab\nClick on Google+ API under Social APIs, then click Enable API\nClick on Google Drive API under G Suite, then click Enable API\nClick on Google Sheets API under G Suite, then click Enable API\nNext, under APIs & auth in the sidebar click on Credentials tab\nClick on Create new Client ID button\nSelect Web Application and click on Configure Consent Screen\nFill out the required fields then click on Save\nIn the Create Client ID modal dialog:\nApplication Type: Web Application\nAuthorized Javascript origins: http:\/\/localhost:8080\nAuthorized redirect URI: http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/google\/callback\nClick on Create Client ID button\nCopy and paste Client ID and Client secret keys into .env\n\nNote: When you ready to deploy to production don't forget to\nadd your new URL to Authorized Javascript origins and Authorized redirect URI,\ne.g. http:\/\/my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com and\nhttp:\/\/my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com\/auth\/google\/callback respectively.\nThe same goes for other providers.\n\n\n\nVisit Snap Kit Developer Portal\nClick on the + button to create an app\nEnter a name for your app\nEnable the scopes that you will want to use in your app\nClick on the Continue button\nFind the Kits section and make sure that Login Kit is enabled\nFind the Redirect URLs section, click the + Add button, and enter http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/snapchat\/callback\nFind the Development Environment section. Click the Generate button next to the Confidential OAuth2 Client heading within it.\nCopy and paste the generated Private Key and OAuth2 Client ID keys into .env\nNote: OAuth2 Client ID is SNAPCHAT_ID, Private Key is SNAPCHAT_SECRET in .env\nTo prepare the app for submission, fill out the rest of the required fields: Category, Description, Privacy Policy Url, and App Icon\n\nNote: For production use, don't forget to:\n\ngenerate a Confidential OAuth2 Client in the Production Environment and use the production Private Key and OAuth2 Client ID\nadd the production URL to Redirect URLs section, e.g. http:\/\/my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com\/auth\/snapchat\/callback\nsubmit the app for review and wait for approval\n\n\n\n\nVisit Facebook Developers\nClick My Apps, then select *Add a New App from the dropdown menu\nEnter a new name for your app\nClick on the Create App ID button\nFind the Facebook Login Product and click on Facebook Login\nInstead of going through their Quickstart, click on Settings for your app in the top left corner\nCopy and paste App ID and App Secret keys into .env\nNote: App ID is FACEBOOK_ID, App Secret is FACEBOOK_SECRET in .env\nEnter localhost under App Domains\nChoose a Category that best describes your app\nClick on + Add Platform and select Website\nEnter http:\/\/localhost:8080 under Site URL\nClick on the Settings tab in the left nav under Facebook Login\nEnter http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/facebook\/callback under Valid OAuth redirect URIs\n\nNote: After a successful sign in with Facebook, a user will be redirected back to the home page with appended hash #_=_ in the URL. It is not a bug. See this Stack Overflow discussion for ways to handle it.\n\n\n\nGo to Account Settings\nSelect Developer settings from the sidebar\nThen click on OAuth Apps and then on Register new application\nEnter Application Name and Homepage URL\nFor Authorization Callback URL: http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/github\/callback\nClick Register application\nNow copy and paste Client ID and Client Secret keys into .env file\n\n\n\n\nSign in at https:\/\/apps.twitter.com\nClick Create a new application\nEnter your application name, website and description\nFor Callback URL: http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8080\/auth\/twitter\/callback\nGo to Settings tab\nUnder Application Type select Read and Write access\nCheck the box Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter\nClick Update this Twitter's applications settings\nCopy and paste Consumer Key and Consumer Secret keys into .env file\n\n\n\n\nSign in at LinkedIn Developer Network\nFrom the account name dropdown menu select API Keys\nIt may ask you to sign in once again\nClick + Add New Application button\nFill out all the required fields\nOAuth 2.0 Redirect URLs: http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/linkedin\/callback\nJavaScript API Domains: http:\/\/localhost:8080\nFor Default Application Permissions make sure at least the following is checked:\nr_basicprofile\nFinish by clicking Add Application button\nCopy and paste API Key and Secret Key keys into .env file\nAPI Key is your clientID\nSecret Key is your clientSecret\n\n\n\n\nSign up or log into your dashboard\nClick on your profile and click on Account Settings\nThen click on API Keys\nCopy the Secret Key. and add this into .env file\n\n\n\n\nVisit PayPal Developer\nLog in to your PayPal account\nClick Applications > Create App in the navigation bar\nEnter Application Name, then click Create app\nCopy and paste Client ID and Secret keys into .env file\nApp ID is client_id, App Secret is client_secret\nChange host to api.paypal.com if you want to test against production and use the live credentials\n\n\n\n\nGo to Foursquare for Developers\nClick on My Apps in the top menu\nClick the Create A New App button\nEnter App Name, Welcome page url,\nFor Redirect URI: http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/foursquare\/callback\nClick Save Changes\nCopy and paste Client ID and Client Secret keys into .env file\n\n\n\n\nGo to http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/oauth\/apps\nOnce signed in, click +Register application\nFill in all the details\nFor Default Callback URL: http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/tumblr\/callback\nClick \u2714Register\nCopy and paste OAuth consumer key and OAuth consumer secret keys into .env file\n\n\n\n\nGo to http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/dev\/apikey\nSign in with your existing Steam account\nEnter your Domain Name, then and click Register\nCopy and paste Key into .env file\n\n\n\n\nVisit the Twitch developer dashboard\nIf prompted, authorize the dashboard to access your twitch account\nIn the Console, click on Register Your Application\nEnter the name of your application\nUse OAuth Redirect URLs enter http:\/\/localhost:8080\/auth\/twitch\/callback\nSet Category to Website Integration and press the Create button\nAfter the applicaiton has been created, click on the Manage button\nCopy and paste Client ID into .env\nIf there is no Client Secret displayed, click on New Secret button and then copy and paste the Client secret into .env\n\n\n\n\nGo to https:\/\/sendgrid.com\/user\/signup\nSign up and confirm your account via the activation email\nThen enter your SendGrid Username and Password into .env file\n\n\n\n\nGo to http:\/\/www.mailgun.com\nSign up and add your Domain Name\nFrom the domain overview, copy and paste the default SMTP Login and Password into .env file\n\n\n\n\nGo to https:\/\/developer.here.com\nSign up and create a Freemium project\nCreate JAVASCRIPT\/REST credentials.

async.parallel() when you need to run multiple\nasynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might want to scrape three different websites for some data and render the results in a template after all three websites have been scraped.\nNeed to find a specific object inside an Array? Use _.find\nfunction from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a\nTwitter token from database: var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });,\nwhere 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.\n\nFAQ\nWhy do I get 403 Error: Forbidden when submitting a form?\nYou need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been\nadded in the pull request #40\nas part of the CSRF protection.\ninput(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)\n\nNote: It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can\nspecify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.\nNote 2: To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the\nCSRF middleware to see if req.originalUrl matches your desired pattern.\nI am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?\nThat's a custom error message defined in app.js to indicate that there was a\nproblem connecting to MongoDB:\nmongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  console.log('%s MongoDB connection error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.', chalk.red('\u2717'));\n  process.exit();\n});\nYou need to have a MongoDB server running before launching app.js. You can\ndownload MongoDB here, or install it via a package manager.\n\nWindows users, read Install MongoDB on Windows.\nTip: If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use\nMongoDB Atlas or Compose instead\nof downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update database credentials\nin .env file.\nI get an error when I deploy my app, why?\nChances are you haven't changed the Database URI in .env. If MONGODB is\nset to localhost, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is\nrunning. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB\nrunning on localhost. You need to create an account with MongoDB Atlas\nor Compose, then create a free tier database.\nSee Deployment for more information on how to setup an account\nand a new database step-by-step with MongoDB Atlas.\nWhy Pug (Jade) instead of Handlebars?\nWhen I first started this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find extends and block to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.\nWhy do you have all routes defined in app.js?\nFor the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,\nsuch as passing app context to each controller as outlined in this\nblog,\nI find such style to be confusing for beginners.\nIt took me a long time to grasp the concept of exports and module.exports,\nlet alone having a global app reference in other files.\nThat to me is backward thinking.\nThe app.js is the \"heart of the app\", it should be the one referencing\nmodels, routes, controllers, etc.\nWhen working solo on small projects, I prefer to have everything inside app.js as is the case with this\nREST API server.\nHow do I switch SendGrid for another email delivery service, like Mailgun or SparkPost?\nInside the nodemailer.createTransport method arguments, change the service from 'Sendgrid' to some other email service. Also, be sure to update both username and password below that. See the list of all supported services by Nodemailer.\nHow It Works (mini guides)\nThis section is intended for giving you a detailed explanation of\nhow a particular functionality works. Maybe you are just curious about\nhow it works, or perhaps you are lost and confused while reading the code,\nI hope it provides some guidance to you.\nCustom HTML and CSS Design 101\nHTML5 UP has many beautiful templates that you can download for free.\nWhen you download the ZIP file, it will come with index.html, images, css and js folders. So, how do you\nintegrate it with Hackathon Starter? Hackathon Starter uses Bootstrap CSS framework, but these templates do not.\nTrying to use both CSS files at the same time will likely result in undesired effects.\nNote: Using the custom templates approach, you should understand that you cannot reuse any of the views I have created: layout, home page, api browser, login, signup, account management, contact. Those views were built using Bootstrap grid and styles. You will have to manually update the grid using a different syntax provided in the template. Having said that, you can mix and match if you want to do so: Use Bootstrap for main app interface, and a custom template for a landing page.\nLet's start from the beginning. For this example I will use Escape Velocity template:\n\nNote: For the sake of simplicity I will only consider index.html, and skip left-sidebar.html,\nno-sidebar.html, right-sidebar.html.\nMove all JavaScript files from html5up-escape-velocity\/js to public\/js. Then move all CSS files from html5up-escape-velocity\/css to public\/css. And finally, move all images from html5up-escape-velocity\/images to public\/images. You could move it to the existing img folder, but that would require manually changing every img reference. Grab the contents of index.html and paste it into HTML To Pug.\nNote: Do not forget to update all the CSS and JS paths accordingly.\nCreate a new file escape-velocity.pug and paste the Pug markup in views folder.\nWhenever you see the code res.render('account\/login') - that means it will search for views\/account\/login.pug file.\nLet's see how it looks. Create a new controller escapeVelocity inside controllers\/home.js:\nexports.escapeVelocity = (req, res) => {\n  res.render('escape-velocity', {\n    title: 'Landing Page'\n  });\n};\nAnd then create a route in app.js. I placed it right after the index controller:\napp.get('\/escape-velocity', homeController.escapeVelocity);\nRestart the server (if you are not using nodemon); then you should see the new template at http:\/\/localhost:8080\/escape-velocity.\nI will stop right here, but if you would like to use this template as more than just a single page, take a look at how these Pug templates work: layout.pug - base template, index.pug - home page, partials\/header.pug - Bootstrap navbar, partials\/footer.pug - sticky footer. You will have to manually break it apart into smaller pieces. Figure out which part of the template you want to keep the same on all pages - that's your new layout.pug.\nThen, each page that changes, be it index.pug, about.pug, contact.pug\nwill be embedded in your new layout.pug via block content. Use existing templates as a reference.\nThis is a rather lengthy process, and templates you get from elsewhere might have yet another grid system. That's why I chose Bootstrap for the Hackathon Starter.\nMany people are already familiar with Bootstrap, plus it's easy to get started with it if you have never used Bootstrap.\nYou can also buy many beautifully designed Bootstrap themes at Themeforest, and use them as a drop-in replacement for Hackathon Starter. However, if you would like to go with a completely custom HTML\/CSS design, this should help you to get started!\n\nHow do flash messages work in this project?\nFlash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access\nit on next request and only next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would\ndisplay an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different\npage and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once.\nThis project uses express-flash module for flash messages. And that\nmodule is built on top of connect-flash, which is what I used in\nthis project initially. With express-flash you don't have to\nexplicitly send a flash message to every view inside res.render().\nAll flash messages are available in your views via messages object by default,\nthanks to express-flash.\nFlash messages have a two-step process. You use req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' }\nto create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:\nif messages.errors\n  .alert.alert-danger.fade.in\n    for error in messages.errors\n      div= error.msg\nIn the first step, 'errors' is the name of a flash message, which should match the\nname of the property on messages object in your views. You place alert messages\ninside if message.errors because you don't want to show them flash messages are present.\nThe reason why you pass an error like { msg: 'Error message goes here' } instead\nof just a string - 'Error message goes here', is for the sake of consistency.\nTo clarify that, express-validator module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input,\nreturns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a msg property with a message why an error has occurred. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:\n[\n  { param: \"name\", msg: \"Name is required\", value: \"<received input>\" },\n  { param: \"email\", msg: \"A valid email is required\", value: \"<received input>\" }\n]\nTo keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages\nas { msg: 'My flash message' } instead of a string. Otherwise, you will see an alert box\nwithout an error message. That is because in partials\/flash.pug template it will try to output\nerror.msg (i.e. \"My flash message\".msg), in other words, it will try to call a msg method on a String object,\nwhich will return undefined. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies\nto \"info\" and \"success\" flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as:\nData Usage Controller (Example)\nreq.flash('warning', { msg: 'You have exceeded 90% of your data usage' });\n\nUser Account Page (Example)\nif messages.warning\n  .alert.alert-warning.fade.in\n    for warning in messages.warning\n      div= warning.msg\npartials\/flash.pug is a partial template that contains how flash messages\nare formatted. Previously, flash\nmessages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages\n(contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it uses a DRY approach.\nThe flash messages partial template is included in the layout.pug, along with footer and navigation.\nbody\n    include partials\/header\n\n    .container\n      include partials\/flash\n      block content\n\n    include partials\/footer\nIf you have any further questions about flash messages,\nplease feel free to open an issue, and I will update this mini-guide accordingly,\nor send a pull request if you would like to include something that I missed.\n\nHow do I create a new page?\nA more correct way to say this would be \"How do I create a new route?\" The main file app.js contains all the routes.\nEach route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see three or more arguments for a route. In a case like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments\nare what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from\ncontinuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.\napp.get('\/account', passportConfig.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);\nIt always goes from left to right. A user visits \/account page. Then isAuthenticated middleware checks if you are authenticated:\nexports.isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {\n  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {\n    return next();\n  }\n  res.redirect('\/login');\n};\nIf you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your \"door\" by calling return next();. It then proceeds to the\nnext middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on GET requests or redirects on POST requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to the Account Management page; otherwise, you will be redirected to the Login page.\nexports.getAccount = (req, res) => {\n  res.render('account\/profile', {\n    title: 'Account Management'\n  });\n};\nExpress.js has app.get, app.post, app.put, app.delete, but for the most part, you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.\nIf you just want to display a page, then use GET, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use POST.\nHere is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building a page that lists all books from the database.\nStep 1. Start by defining a route.\napp.get('\/books', bookController.getBooks);\n\nNote: As of Express 4.x you can define your routes like so:\napp.route('\/books')\n  .get(bookController.getBooks)\n  .post(bookController.createBooks)\n  .put(bookController.updateBooks)\n  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)\nAnd here is how a route would look if it required an authentication and an authorization middleware:\napp.route('\/api\/twitter')\n  .all(passportConfig.isAuthenticated)\n  .all(passportConfig.isAuthorized)\n  .get(apiController.getTwitter)\n  .post(apiController.postTwitter)\nUse whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I think that chaining HTTP verbs on app.route is a very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand, I can no longer see all my routes at a glance when you have one route per line.\nStep 2. Create a new schema and a model Book.js inside the models directory.\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  name: String\n});\n\nconst Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);\nmodule.exports = Book;\nStep 3. Create a new controller file called book.js inside the controllers directory.\n\/**\n * GET \/books\n * List all books.\n *\/\nconst Book = require('..\/models\/Book.js');\n\nexports.getBooks = (req, res) => {\n  Book.find((err, docs) => {\n    res.render('books', { books: docs });\n  });\n};\nStep 4. Import that controller in app.js.\nconst bookController = require('.\/controllers\/book');\nStep 5. Create books.pug template.\nextends layout\n\nblock content\n  .page-header\n    h3 All Books\n\n  ul\n    for book in books\n      li= book.name\nThat's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:\napp.get('\/books',(req, res) => {\n  Book.find((err, docs) => {\n    res.render('books', { books: docs });\n  });\n});\nSure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in app.js it becomes a little challenging to navigate the file.\nI mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could\nwork with your teammates without running into MERGE CONFLICTS. Imagine you have four developers\nworking on a single app.js, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.\nIf you are the only developer, then it's okay. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes difficult to maintain everything in a single file.\nThat's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.\nMost of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:\nMongoose for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,\nsending emails via Nodemailer, form validation using express-validator library,\nparsing websites using Cheerio, etc.\n\nHow do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?\nDan Stroot submitted an excellent pull request that adds a real-time dashboard with socket.io.\nAnd as  much as I'd like to add it to the project, I think it violates one of the main\nprinciples of the Hackathon Starter:\n\nWhen I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.\nI also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of\nhackathon web apps, without being too specific.\n\nWhen I need to use socket.io, I really need it, but most of the time - I don't. But more importantly, websockets support is still experimental on most hosting providers. As of October 2013,\nHeroku supports websockets, but not until you opt-in by running this command:\nheroku labs:enable websockets -a myapp\nAnd what if you are deploying to OpenShift? They do support websockets, but it is currently in a\npreview state. So, for OpenShift you would need to change the socket.io connect URI to the following:\nconst socket = io.connect('http:\/\/yoursite-namespace.rhcloud.com:8000');\nWait, why is it on port 8000? Who knows, and if I didn't run across this blog post\nI wouldn't even know I had to use port 8000.\nI am really glad that Heroku and OpenShift at least\nhave a websockets support, because many other PaaS providers still do not support it.\nDue to the aforementioned issues with websockets, I cannot include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. For now...\nIf you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading.\nFirst, you need to install socket.io:\nnpm install socket.io\nReplace const app = express(); with the following code:\nconst app = express();\nconst server = require('http').Server(app);\nconst io = require('socket.io')(server);\nI like to have the following code organization in app.js (from top to bottom): module dependencies,\nimport controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes,\nstart the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things.\nAdd the following code at the end of app.js:\nio.on('connection', (socket) => {\n  socket.emit('greet', { hello: 'Hey there browser!' });\n  socket.on('respond', (data) => {\n    console.log(data);\n  });\n  socket.on('disconnect', () => {\n    console.log('Socket disconnected');\n  });\n});\nOne last thing left to change:\napp.listen(app.get('port'), () => {\nto\nserver.listen(app.get('port'), () => {\nAt this point, we are done with the back-end.\nYou now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Pug templates or have all your client-side\nJavaScript in a separate file - in main.js. I admit, when I first started with Node.js and JavaScript in general,\nI placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express\nright then and there. It's the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I\nalmost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore.\nBut it's also understandable if you want to take the easier road.\nMost of the time you don't even care about performance during hackathons, you just\nwant to \"get shit done\" before the time runs out.\nWell, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day,\nit's what you build that matters, not how you build it.\nIf you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in layout.pug -\nyour main template file, add this to head block.\nscript(src='\/socket.io\/socket.io.js')\nscript.\n    let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);\n    socket.on('greet', function (data) {\n      console.log(data);\n      socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hey there, server!' });\n    });\nNote: Notice the path of the socket.io.js, you don't actually\nhave to have socket.io.js file anywhere in your project; it will be generated\nautomatically at runtime.\nIf you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline\nscript code into main.js, inside the $(document).ready() function:\n$(document).ready(function() {\n\n  \/\/ Place JavaScript code here...\n  let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);\n  socket.on('greet', function (data) {\n    console.log(data);\n    socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hey there, server!' });\n  });\n\n});\nAnd we are done!\nCheatsheets\n ES6 Cheatsheet\nDeclarations\nDeclares a read-only named constant.\nconst name = 'yourName';\nDeclares a block scope local variable.\nlet index = 0;\nTemplate Strings\nUsing the `${}` syntax, strings can embed expressions.\nconst name = 'Oggy';\nconst age = 3;\n\nconsole.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);\nModules\nTo import functions, objects or primitives exported from an external module. These are the most common types of importing.\nconst name = require('module-name');\nconst { foo, bar } = require('module-name');\nTo export functions, objects or primitives from a given file or module.\nmodule.exports = { myFunction };\nmodule.exports.name = 'yourName';\nmodule.exports = myFunctionOrClass;\nSpread Operator\nThe spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\nmyFunction(...iterableObject);\n<ChildComponent {...this.props} \/>\nPromises\nA Promise is used in asynchronous computations to represent an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.\nvar p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { });\nThe catch() method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only.\np.catch(function(reason) { \/* handle rejection *\/ });\nThe then() method returns a Promise. It takes two arguments: callback for the success & failure cases.\np.then(function(value) { \/* handle fulfillment *\/ }, function(reason) { \/* handle rejection *\/ });\nThe Promise.all(iterable) method returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.\nPromise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(function(values) { console.log(values) });\nArrow Functions\nArrow function expression.

To use a port other than 8080, you would need to modify the port in app.js, Dockerfile, and docker-compose.yml.\nDeployment\nOnce you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top picks. From my experience, the easiest way to get started is with Heroku. It will automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, has zero-downtime deployments and supports custom domains on free accounts. Additionally, you can\ncreate an account with MongoDB Atlas and then pick one of the 4 providers below.\nAgain, there are plenty of other choices, and you are not limited to just the ones\nlisted below.\nDeployment to Heroku\n\n\nDownload and install Heroku Toolbelt\nIn a terminal, run heroku login and enter your Heroku credentials\nFrom your app directory run heroku create\nUse the command heroku config:set KEY=val to set the different environment variables (KEY=val) for your application (i.e.  heroku config:set BASE_URL=[heroku App Name].herokuapp.com or heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=mongodb:\/\/dbuser:<password>@cluster0-shard-00-00-sdf32.mongodb.net:27017,cluster0-shard-00-01-sdf32.mongodb.net:27017\/<dbname>?ssl=true&retryWrites=true&w=majority (see Hosted MongoDB Atlas below), etc.)  Make sure to set the environment variables for SENDGRID_USER, SENDGRID_PASSWORD, and any other API that you are using as well.\nLastly, do git push heroku master.\n\nPlease note that you may also use the Herko Dashboard to set or modify the configurations for your application.\n\nHosted MongoDB Atlas\n\n\nGo to https:\/\/www.mongodb.com\/cloud\/atlas\nClick the green Get started free button\nFill in your information then hit Get started free\nYou will be redirected to Create New Cluster page.\nSelect a Cloud Provider and Region (such as AWS and a free tier region)\nSelect cluster Tier to Free Shared Clusters\nGive Cluster a name (default: Cluster0)\nClick on green \u26a1Create Cluster button\nNow, to access your database you need to create a DB user. To create a new MongoDB user, from the Clusters view, select the Security tab\nUnder the MongoDB Users tab, click on +Add New User\nFill in a username and password and give it either Atlas Admin User Privilege\nNext, you will need to create an IP address whitelist and obtain the connection URI.  In the Clusters view, under the cluster details (i.e. SANDBOX - Cluster0), click on the CONNECT button.\nUnder section (1) Check the IP Whitelist, click on ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE. The form will add a field with 0.0.0.0\/0.  Click SAVE to save the 0.0.0.0\/0 whitelist.\nUnder section (2) Choose a connection method, click on Connect Your Application\nIn the new screen, select Node.js as Driver and version 2.2.12 or later. WARNING: Do not pick 3.0 or later since connect-mongo can't handle mongodb+srv:\/\/ connection strings.\nFinally, copy the URI connection string and replace the URI in MONGODB_URI of .env.example with this URI string.  Make sure to replace the  with the db User password that you created under the Security tab.\nNote that after some of the steps in the Atlas UI, you may see a banner stating We are deploying your changes.  You will need to wait for the deployment to finish before using the DB in your application.\n\nNote: As an alternative to MongoDB Atlas, there is also Compose.\n\nOpenShift\n\n**NOTE** *These instructions might be out of date due to changes in OpenShift. Heroku is currently a good free alternative.  If you the new process, please feel free to help us update this page*\n\nFirst, install this Ruby gem: sudo gem install rhc \ud83d\udc8e\nRun rhc login and enter your OpenShift credentials\nFrom your app directory run rhc app create MyApp nodejs-0.10\nNote: MyApp is the name of your app (no spaces)\nOnce that is done, you will be provided with URL, SSH and Git Remote links\nVisit provided URL, and you should see the Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift page\nCopy and paste Git Remote into git remote add openshift YOUR_GIT_REMOTE\nBefore you push your app, you need to do a few modifications to your code\n\nAdd these two lines to app.js, just place them anywhere before app.listen():\nvar IP_ADDRESS = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || '127.0.0.1';\nvar PORT = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;\nThen change app.listen() to:\napp.listen(PORT, IP_ADDRESS,() => {\n  console.log(`Express server listening on port ${PORT} in ${app.settings.env} mode`);\n});\nAdd this to package.json, after name and version. This is necessary because, by default, OpenShift looks for server.js file. And by specifying supervisor app.js it will automatically restart the server when node.js process crashes.\n\"main\": \"app.js\",\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"supervisor app.js\"\n},\n\nFinally, you can now push your code to OpenShift by running git push -f openshift master\nNote: The first time you run this command, you have to pass -f (force) flag because OpenShift creates a dummy server with the welcome page when you create a new Node.js app. Passing -f flag will override everything with your Hackathon Starter project repository. Do not run git pull as it will create unnecessary merge conflicts.\nAnd you are done!\n\n\nAzure\n\n**NOTE** *Beyond the initial 12 month trial of Azure, the platform does not seem to offer a free tier for hosting NodeJS apps.

With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. Which means, you won't have to change your whole application source code to an open source license. [Purchase a Fullpage Commercial License]\nOpen source license\nIf you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the GNU GPL license v3, you may use fullPage under the terms of the GPLv3.\nThe credit comments in the JavaScript and CSS files should be kept intact (even after combination or minification)\nRead more about fullPage's license.\nUsage\nAs you can see in the example files, you will need to include:\n\nThe JavaScript file fullpage.js (or its minified version fullpage.min.js)\nThe css file fullpage.css\n\nOptionally, when using css3:false, you can add the easings file in case you want to use other easing effects apart from the one included in the library (easeInOutCubic).\nInstall using bower or npm\nOptionally, you can install fullPage.js with bower or npm if you prefer:\nTerminal:\n\/\/ With bower\nbower install fullpage.js\n\n\/\/ With npm\nnpm install fullpage.js\nIncluding files:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\" href=\"fullpage.css\" \/>\n\n<!-- This following line is optional. Only necessary if you use the option css3:false and you want to use other easing effects rather than \"easeInOutCubic\". -->\n<script src=\"vendors\/easings.min.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n<!-- This following line is only necessary in the case of using the option `scrollOverflow:true` -->\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"vendors\/scrolloverflow.min.js\"><\/script>\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"fullpage.js\"><\/script>\nUsing Webpack, Browserify or Require.js? Check how to use fullPage.js with module loaders.\nOptional use of CDN\nIf you prefer to use a CDN to load the needed files, fullPage.js is in CDNJS:\nhttps:\/\/cdnjs.com\/libraries\/fullPage.js\nRequired HTML structure\nStart your HTML document with the compulsory HTML DOCTYPE declaration on the 1st line of your HTML code. You might have troubles with sections heights otherwise. The examples provided use HTML 5 doctype <!DOCTYPE html>.\nEach section will be defined with an element containing the section class.\nThe active section by default will be the first section, which is taken as the home page.\nSections should be placed inside a wrapper (<div id=\"fullpage\"> in this case). The wrapper can not be the body element.\n<div id=\"fullpage\">\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section<\/div>\n<\/div>\nIf you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section, just add the class active to the section and slide you want to load first.\n<div class=\"section active\">Some section<\/div>\nIn order to create a landscape slider within a section, each slide will be defined by default with an element containing the slide class:\n<div class=\"section\">\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 1 <\/div>\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 2 <\/div>\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 3 <\/div>\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 4 <\/div>\n<\/div>\nYou can see a fully working example of the HTML structure in the simple.html file.\nInitialization\nInitialization with Vanilla Javascript\nAll you need to do is call fullPage.js before the closing <\/body> tag.\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\n\t\/\/options here\n\tautoScrolling:true,\n\tscrollHorizontally: true\n});\n\n\/\/methods\nfullpage_api.setAllowScrolling(false);\nInitialization with jQuery\nYou can use fullpage.js as a jQuery plugin if you want to!\n$(document).ready(function() {\n\t$('#fullpage').fullpage({\n\t\t\/\/options here\n\t\tautoScrolling:true,\n\t\tscrollHorizontally: true\n\t});\n\n\t\/\/methods\n\t$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false);\n});\nFunctions and methods can still be called in the jQuery way, as in fullPage.js v2.X.\nVanilla JS example with all options\nA more complex initialization with all options set could look like this:\nvar myFullpage = new fullpage('#fullpage', {\n\t\/\/Navigation\n\tmenu: '#menu',\n\tlockAnchors: false,\n\tanchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage'],\n\tnavigation: false,\n\tnavigationPosition: 'right',\n\tnavigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide'],\n\tshowActiveTooltip: false,\n\tslidesNavigation: false,\n\tslidesNavPosition: 'bottom',\n\n\t\/\/Scrolling\n\tcss3: true,\n\tscrollingSpeed: 700,\n\tautoScrolling: true,\n\tfitToSection: true,\n\tfitToSectionDelay: 1000,\n\tscrollBar: false,\n\teasing: 'easeInOutCubic',\n\teasingcss3: 'ease',\n\tloopBottom: false,\n\tloopTop: false,\n\tloopHorizontal: true,\n\tcontinuousVertical: false,\n\tcontinuousHorizontal: false,\n\tscrollHorizontally: false,\n\tinterlockedSlides: false,\n\tdragAndMove: false,\n\toffsetSections: false,\n\tresetSliders: false,\n\tfadingEffect: false,\n\tnormalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2',\n\tscrollOverflow: false,\n\tscrollOverflowReset: false,\n\tscrollOverflowOptions: null,\n\ttouchSensitivity: 15,\n\tbigSectionsDestination: null,\n\n\t\/\/Accessibility\n\tkeyboardScrolling: true,\n\tanimateAnchor: true,\n\trecordHistory: true,\n\n\t\/\/Design\n\tcontrolArrows: true,\n\tverticalCentered: true,\n\tsectionsColor : ['#ccc', '#fff'],\n\tpaddingTop: '3em',\n\tpaddingBottom: '10px',\n\tfixedElements: '#header, .footer',\n\tresponsiveWidth: 0,\n\tresponsiveHeight: 0,\n\tresponsiveSlides: false,\n\tparallax: false,\n\tparallaxOptions: {type: 'reveal', percentage: 62, property: 'translate'},\n\tcards: false,\n\tcardsOptions: {perspective: 100, fadeContent: true, fadeBackground: true},\n\n\t\/\/Custom selectors\n\tsectionSelector: '.section',\n\tslideSelector: '.slide',\n\n\tlazyLoading: true,\n\n\t\/\/events\n\tonLeave: function(origin, destination, direction){},\n\tafterLoad: function(origin, destination, direction){},\n\tafterRender: function(){},\n\tafterResize: function(width, height){},\n\tafterReBuild: function(){},\n\tafterResponsive: function(isResponsive){},\n\tafterSlideLoad: function(section, origin, destination, direction){},\n\tonSlideLeave: function(section, origin, destination, direction){}\n});\nCreating links to sections or slides\nIf you are using fullPage.js with anchor links for the sections (using the anchors option or the attribute data-anchor in each section), then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.\nThis would be an example of a link with an anchor: http:\/\/alvarotrigo.com\/fullPage\/#secondPage\/2 (which is the URL you will see once you access to that section\/slide manually)\nNotice the last part of the URL ends in #secondPage\/2.\nHaving the following initialization:\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\n\tanchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage']\n});\nThe anchor at the end of the URL #secondPage\/2 defines the section and slide of destination respectively. In the previous URL, the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor secondPage and the slide will be the 2nd slide, as we are using the index 2 for it. (the fist slide of a section has index 0, as technically it is a section).\nWe could have used a custom anchor for the slide instead of its index if we would have used the attribute data-anchor on the HTML markup like so:\n<div class=\"section\">\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide1\"> Slide 1 <\/div>\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide2\"> Slide 2 <\/div>\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide3\"> Slide 3 <\/div>\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide4\"> Slide 4 <\/div>\n<\/div>\nIn this last case, the URL we would use would be #secondPage\/slide3, which is the equivalent to our previous #secondPage\/2.\nNote that section anchors can also be defined in the same way, by using the data-anchor attribute, if no anchors array is provided.\nBe careful! data-anchor tags can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE).\nCreating smaller or bigger sections\nDemo fullPage.js provides a way to remove the full height restriction from its sections and slides. It is possible to create sections which height is smaller or bigger than the viewport. This is ideal for footers.\nIt is important to realise that it doesn't make sense to have all of your sections using this feature. If there is more than one section in the initial load of the site, fullPage.js won't scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport.\nTo create smaller sections just use the class fp-auto-height in the section you want to apply it. It will then take the height defined by your section\/slide content.\n<div class=\"section\">Whole viewport<\/div>\n<div class=\"section fp-auto-height\">Auto height<\/div>\nResponsive auto height sections\nDemo A responsive auto height can be applied by using the class fp-auto-height-responsive. This way sections will be fullscreen until the responsive mode gets fired. Then they'll take the size required by their content, which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport.\nState classes added by fullpage.js\nFullpage.js adds multiple classes in different elements to keep a record of the status of the site:\n\nactive is added the current visible section and slide.\nactive is added to the current menu element (if using the menu option).\nA class of the form fp-viewing-SECTION-SLIDE is added to the body element of the site. (eg: fp-viewing-secondPage-0) The SECTION and SLIDE parts will be the anchors (or indexes if no anchor is provided) of the current section and slide.\nfp-responsive is added to the body element when the entering in the responsive mode\nfp-enabled is added to the html element when fullpage.js is enabled. (and removed when destroyed).\nfp-destroyed is added to the fullpage.js container when fullPage.js is destroyed.\n\nLazy Loading\nDemo fullPage.js provides a way to lazy load images, videos and audio elements so they won't slow down the loading of your site or unnecessarily waste data transfer.\nWhen using lazy loading, all these elements will only get loaded when entering in the viewport.\nTo enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your src attribute to data-src as shown below:\n<img data-src=\"image.png\">\n<video>\n\t<source data-src=\"video.webm\" type=\"video\/webm\" \/>\n\t<source data-src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\" \/>\n<\/video>\nIf you already use another lazy load solution which uses data-src as well, you can disable the fullPage.js lazy loading by setting the option lazyLoading: false.\nAuto play\/pause embedded media\nDemo Note: the autoplay feature might not work on some mobile devices depending on the OS and browser (i.e. Safari on iOS version < 10.0).\nPlay on section\/slide load:\nUsing the attribute autoplay for videos or audio, or the param autoplay=1 for youtube iframes will result in the media element playing on page load.\nIn order to play it on section\/slide load use instead the attribute data-autoplay. For example:\n<audio data-autoplay>\n\t<source src=\"http:\/\/metakoncept.hr\/horse.ogg\" type=\"audio\/ogg\">\n<\/audio>\nPause on leave\nEmbedded HTML5 <video> \/ <audio>  and Youtube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a section or slide. This can be disabled by using the attribute data-keepplaying. For example:\n<audio data-keepplaying>\n\t<source src=\"http:\/\/metakoncept.hr\/horse.ogg\" type=\"audio\/ogg\">\n<\/audio>\nUse extensions\nfullpage.js provides a set of extensions you can use to enhance its default features. All of them are listed as fullpage.js options.\nExtensions requires you to use the minified file fullpage.extensions.min.js that is inside the dist folder instead of the usual fullPage.js file (fullpage.js or fullpage.min.js).\nOnce you acquire the extension file, you will need to add it before fullPage. For example, if I want to use the Continuous Horizontal extension, I would have include the extension file and then the extensions version of the fullPage file.\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"fullpage.continuousHorizontal.min.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"fullpage\/fullpage.extensions.min.js\"><\/script>\nAn activation key and a license key will be required for each extension. See more details about it here.\nThen you will be able to use and configure them as explained in options.\nOptions\n\nlicenseKey: (default null). This option is compulsory. If you use fullPage in a non open source project, then you should use the license key provided on the purchase of the fullPage Commercial License. If your project is open source and it is compatible with the GPLv3 license you can request a license key. Please read more about licenses here and on the website. For example:\n\nnew fullpage({\n    licenseKey: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'\n});\n\n\nv2compatible: (default false). Determines whether to make it 100% compatible with any code written for version 2, ignoring new features or api changes of version 3. State classes, callbacks signature etc. will work exactly in the same way as it did on verion 2. Note that this option will be removed at some point in the future..\n\n\ncontrolArrows: (default true) Determines whether to use control arrows for the slides to move right or left.\n\n\nverticalCentered: (default true) Vertically centering of the content within sections. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the library. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback.\n\n\nscrollingSpeed: (default 700) Speed in milliseconds for the scrolling transitions.\n\n\nsectionsColor: (default none) Define the CSS background-color property for each section.\nExample:\n\n\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\n\tsectionsColor: ['#f2f2f2', '#4BBFC3', '#7BAABE', 'whitesmoke', '#000'],\n});\n\n\nanchors: (default []) Defines the anchor links (#example) to be shown on the URL for each section. Anchors value should be unique. The position of the anchors in the array will define to which sections the anchor is applied. (second position for second section and so on). Using anchors forward and backward navigation will also be possible through the browser. This option also allows users to bookmark a specific section or slide. Be careful! anchors can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE).\nNow anchors can be defined directly in the HTML structure by using the attribute data-anchor as explained here.\n\n\nlockAnchors: (default false) Determines whether anchors in the URL will have any effect at all in the library. You can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks, but they won't have any effect in the scrolling of the site. Useful if you want to combine fullPage.js with other plugins using anchor in the URL.\n\n\nImportant It is helpful to understand that the values in the anchors option array correlate directly to the element with the class of .section by it's position in the markup.\n\n\neasing: (default easeInOutCubic) Defines the transition effect to use for the vertical and horizontal scrolling.\nIt requires the file vendors\/easings.min.js or jQuery UI for using some of its transitions. Other libraries could be used instead.\n\n\neasingcss3: (default ease) Defines the transition effect to use in case of using css3:true. You can use the pre-defined ones (such as linear, ease-out...) or create your own ones using the cubic-bezier function. You might want to use Matthew Lein CSS Easing Animation Tool for it.\n\n\nloopTop: (default false) Defines whether scrolling up in the first section should scroll to the last one or not.\n\n\nloopBottom: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll to the first one or not.\n\n\nloopHorizontal: (default true) Defines whether horizontal sliders will loop after reaching the last or previous slide or not.\n\n\ncss3: (default true). Defines whether to use JavaScript or CSS3 transforms to scroll within sections and slides. Useful to speed up the movement in tablet and mobile devices with browsers supporting CSS3. If this option is set to true and the browser doesn't support CSS3, a fallback will be used instead.\n\n\nautoScrolling: (default true) Defines whether to use the \"automatic\" scrolling or the \"normal\" one. It also has affects the way the sections fit in the browser\/device window in tablets and mobile phones.\n\n\nfitToSection: (default true) Determines whether or not to fit sections to the viewport or not. When set to true the current active section will always fill the whole viewport. Otherwise the user will be free to stop in the middle of a section.\n\n\nfitToSectionDelay: (default 1000). If fitToSection is set to true, this delays\nthe fitting by the configured milliseconds.\n\n\nscrollBar: (default false) Determines whether to use scroll bar for the vertical sections on site or not. In case of using scroll bar, the autoScrolling functionality will still work as expected. The user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullPage.js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes.\n\n\npaddingTop: (default 0) Defines the top padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingTop: '10px', paddingTop: '10em'...) Useful in case of using a fixed header.\n\n\npaddingBottom: (default 0) Defines the bottom padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingBottom: '10px', paddingBottom: '10em'...). Useful in case of using a fixed footer.\n\n\nfixedElements: (default null) Defines which elements will be taken off the scrolling structure of the plugin which is necessary when using the css3 option to keep them fixed. It requires a string with the Javascript selectors for those elements. (For example: fixedElements: '#element1, .element2')\n\n\nnormalScrollElements: (default null) Demo If you want to avoid the auto scroll when scrolling over some elements, this is the option you need to use. (useful for maps, scrolling divs etc.) It requires a string with the Javascript selectors for those elements. (For example: normalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2'). This option should not be applied to any section\/slide element itself.\n\n\nbigSectionsDestination: (default null) Demo Defines how to scroll to a section which height is bigger than the viewport and when not using scrollOverflow:true. (Read how to create smaller or bigger sections). By default fullPage.js scrolls to the top if you come from a section above the destination one and to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one. Possible values are top, bottom, null.\n\n\nkeyboardScrolling: (default true) Defines if the content can be navigated using the keyboard.\n\n\ntouchSensitivity: (default 5) Defines a percentage of the browsers window width\/height, and how far a swipe must measure for navigating to the next section \/ slide\n\n\ncontinuousVertical: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section or should scroll down to the first one and if scrolling up in the first section should scroll up to the last one. Not compatible with loopTop, loopBottom or any scroll bar present in the site (scrollBar:true or autoScrolling:false).\n\n\ncontinuousHorizontal: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether sliding right in the last slide should slide right to the first one or not, and if scrolling left in the first slide should slide left to the last one or not. Not compatible with loopHorizontal. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\n\n\nscrollHorizontally: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether to slide horizontally within sliders by using the mouse wheel or trackpad. It can only be used when using: autoScrolling:true. Ideal for story telling. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\n\n\ninterlockedSlides: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Determines whether moving one horizontal slider will force the sliding of sliders in other section in the same direction. Possible values are true, false or an array with the interlocked sections. For example [1,3,5] starting by 1. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\n\n\ndragAndMove: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Enables or disables the dragging and flicking of sections and slides by using mouse or fingers. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1. Possible values are:\n\ntrue: enables the feature.\nfalse: disables the feature.\nvertical: enables the feature only vertically.\nhorizontal: enables the feature only horizontally.\nfingersonly: enables the feature for touch devices only.\nmouseonly: enables the feature for desktop devices only (mouse and trackpad).\n\n\n\noffsetSections: (default false)Extension of fullpage.js. Provides a way to use non full screen sections based on percentage. Ideal to show visitors there's more content in the site by showing part of the next or previous section. Requires fullPage.js >= 3.0.1.\nTo define the percentage of each section the attribute data-percentage must be used. The centering of the section in the viewport can be determined by using a boolean value in the attribute data-centered (default to true if not specified). For example:\n\n\n    <div class=\"section\" data-percentage=\"80\" data-centered=\"true\">\n\n\nresetSliders: (default false). Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether or not to reset every slider after leaving its section. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\n\n\nfadingEffect: (default false). Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether to use a fading effect or not instead of the default scrolling one. Possible values are true, false, sections, slides. It can therefore be applied just vertically or horizontally, or to both at the time. It can only be used when using: autoScrolling:true. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\n\n\nanimateAnchor: (default true) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section.\n\n\nrecordHistory: (default true) Defines whether to push the state of the site to the browser's history. When set to true each section\/slide of the site will act as a new page and the back and forward buttons of the browser will scroll the sections\/slides to reach the previous or next state of the site. When set to false, the URL will keep changing but will have no effect on the browser's history. This option is automatically turned off when using autoScrolling:false.\n\n\nmenu: (default false) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class active.\nThis won't generate a menu but will just add the active class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links.\nIn order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, an HTML 5 data-tag (data-menuanchor) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example:\n\n\n<ul id=\"myMenu\">\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"firstPage\" class=\"active\"><a href=\"#firstPage\">First section<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"secondPage\"><a href=\"#secondPage\">Second section<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"thirdPage\"><a href=\"#thirdPage\">Third section<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"fourthPage\"><a href=\"#fourthPage\">Fourth section<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\n\tanchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],\n\tmenu: '#myMenu'\n});\nNote: the menu element should be placed outside the fullpage wrapper in order to avoid problem when using css3:true. Otherwise it will be appended to the body by the plugin itself.\n\n\nnavigation: (default false) If set to true, it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles.\n\n\nnavigationPosition: (default none) It can be set to left or right and defines which position the navigation bar will be shown (if using one).\n\n\nnavigationTooltips: (default []) Defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used. Example: navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide']. You can also define them by using the attribute data-tooltip in each section if you prefer.\n\n\nshowActiveTooltip: (default false) Shows a persistent tooltip for the actively viewed section in the vertical navigation.\n\n\nslidesNavigation: (default false) If set to true it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles for each landscape slider on the site.\n\n\nslidesNavPosition: (default bottom) Defines the position for the landscape navigation bar for sliders. Admits top and bottom as values. You may want to modify the CSS styles to determine the distance from the top or bottom as well as any other style such as color.\n\n\nscrollOverflow: (default false) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section\/slide in case its content is bigger than the height of it. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback.\nIn case of setting it to true, it requires the vendor library scrolloverflow.min.js. This file has to be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin, but after jQuery ( in case of using it).\nFor example:\n\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"vendors\/scrolloverflow.min.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"fullpage.js\"><\/script>\nIn order to prevent fullpage.js from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides use the class fp-noscroll. For example: <div class=\"section fp-noscroll\">\nYou can also prevent scrolloverflow from getting applied on responsive mode when using fp-auto-height-responsive in the section element.\n\n\nscrollOverflowReset: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. When set to true it scrolls up the content of the section\/slide with scroll bar when leaving to another vertical section. This way the section\/slide will always show the start of its content even when scrolling from a section under it.\n\n\nscrollOverflowOptions: when using scrollOverflow:true fullpage.js will make use of a forked and modified version of iScroll.js library. You can customize the scrolling behaviour by providing fullpage.js with the iScroll.js options you want to use. Check its documentation for more info.\n\n\nsectionSelector: (default .section) Defines the Javascript selector used for the plugin sections. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.\n\n\nslideSelector: (default .slide)  Defines the Javascript selector used for the plugin slides.  It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.\n\n\nresponsiveWidth: (default 0)  A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.\n\n\nresponsiveHeight: (default 0)  A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined height in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's height is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.\n\n\nresponsiveSlides: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. When set to true slides will be turned into vertical sections when responsive mode is fired. (by using the responsiveWidth or responsiveHeight options detailed above). Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\n\n\nparallax: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether or not to use the parallax backgrounds effects on sections \/ slides. Read more about how to apply the parallax option.\n\n\nparallaxOptions: (default: { type: 'reveal', percentage: 62, property: 'translate'}). Allows to configure the parameters for the parallax backgrounds effect when using the option parallax:true. Read more about how to apply the parallax option.\n\n\ncards: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether or not to use the cards effect on sections\/slides. Read more about how to apply the cards option.\n\n\ncardsOptions: (default: { perspective: 100, fadeContent: true, fadeBackground: true}). Allows you to configure the parameters for the cards effect when using the option cards:true. Read more about how to apply the cards option.\n\n\nlazyLoading: (default true) Lazy loading is active by default which means it will lazy load any media element containing the attribute data-src as detailed in the Lazy Loading docs . If you want to use any other lazy loading library you can disable this fullpage.js feature.\n\n\nMethods\nYou can see them in action here\ngetActiveSection()\nDemo Gets an Object (type Section) containing the active section and its properties.\nfullpage_api.getActiveSection();\ngetActiveSlide()\nDemo Gets an Object (type Slide) containing the active slide and its properties.\nfullpage_api.getActiveSlide();\nmoveSectionUp()\nDemo Scrolls one section up:\nfullpage_api.moveSectionUp();\n\nmoveSectionDown()\nDemo Scrolls one section down:\nfullpage_api.moveSectionDown();\n\nmoveTo(section, slide)\nDemo Scrolls the page to the given section and slide.

enabling advanced memoization\nand change detection techniques with simple logic. Persistent data presents\na mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always\nyields new updated data.\nImmutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including:\nList, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record.\nThese data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using\nstructural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized\nby Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data.\nImmutable.js also provides a lazy Seq, allowing efficient\nchaining of collection methods like map and filter without creating\nintermediate representations. Create some Seq with Range and Repeat.\nWant to hear more? Watch the presentation about Immutable.js:\n\nGetting started\nInstall immutable using npm.\nnpm install immutable\nThen require it into any module.\nconst { Map } = require('immutable');\nconst map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst map2 = map1.set('b', 50);\nmap1.get('b') + \" vs. \" + map2.get('b'); \/\/ 2 vs. 50\nBrowser\nImmutable.js has no dependencies, which makes it predictable to include in a Browser.\nIt's highly recommended to use a module bundler like webpack,\nrollup, or\nbrowserify. The immutable npm module works\nwithout any additional consideration. All examples throughout the documentation\nwill assume use of this kind of tool.\nAlternatively, Immutable.js may be directly included as a script tag. Download\nor link to a CDN such as CDNJS\nor jsDelivr.\nUse a script tag to directly add Immutable to the global scope:\n<script src=\"immutable.min.js\"><\/script>\n<script>\n  var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\n  var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);\n  map1.get('b'); \/\/ 2\n  map2.get('b'); \/\/ 50\n<\/script>\nOr use an AMD-style loader (such as RequireJS):\nrequire(['.\/immutable.min.js'], function (Immutable) {\n  var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\n  var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);\n  map1.get('b'); \/\/ 2\n  map2.get('b'); \/\/ 50\n});\nFlow & TypeScript\nUse these Immutable collections and sequences as you would use native\ncollections in your Flowtype or TypeScript programs while still taking\nadvantage of type generics, error detection, and auto-complete in your IDE.\nInstalling immutable via npm brings with it type definitions for Flow (v0.55.0 or higher)\nand TypeScript (v2.1.0 or higher), so you shouldn't need to do anything at all!\nUsing TypeScript with Immutable.js v4\nImmutable.js type definitions embrace ES2015. While Immutable.js itself supports\nlegacy browsers and environments, its type definitions require TypeScript's 2015\nlib. Include either \"target\": \"es2015\" or \"lib\": \"es2015\" in your\ntsconfig.json, or provide --target es2015 or --lib es2015 to the\ntsc command.\nconst { Map } = require(\"immutable\");\nconst map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst map2 = map1.set('b', 50);\nmap1.get('b') + \" vs. \" + map2.get('b'); \/\/ 2 vs. 50\nUsing TypeScript with Immutable.js v3 and earlier:\nPrevious versions of Immutable.js include a reference file which you can include\nvia relative path to the type definitions at the top of your file.\n\/\/\/<reference path='.\/node_modules\/immutable\/dist\/immutable.d.ts'\/>\nimport Immutable from require('immutable');\nvar map1: Immutable.Map<string, number>;\nmap1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nvar map2 = map1.set('b', 50);\nmap1.get('b'); \/\/ 2\nmap2.get('b'); \/\/ 50\nThe case for Immutability\nMuch of what makes application development difficult is tracking mutation and\nmaintaining state. Developing with immutable data encourages you to think\ndifferently about how data flows through your application.\nSubscribing to data events throughout your application creates a huge overhead of\nbook-keeping which can hurt performance, sometimes dramatically, and creates\nopportunities for areas of your application to get out of sync with each other\ndue to easy to make programmer error. Since immutable data never changes,\nsubscribing to changes throughout the model is a dead-end and new data can only\never be passed from above.\nThis model of data flow aligns well with the architecture of React\nand especially well with an application designed using the ideas of Flux.\nWhen data is passed from above rather than being subscribed to, and you're only\ninterested in doing work when something has changed, you can use equality.\nImmutable collections should be treated as values rather than objects. While\nobjects represent some thing which could change over time, a value represents\nthe state of that thing at a particular instance of time. This principle is most\nimportant to understanding the appropriate use of immutable data. In order to\ntreat Immutable.js collections as values, it's important to use the\nImmutable.is() function or .equals() method to determine value equality\ninstead of the === operator which determines object reference identity.\nconst { Map } = require('immutable');\nconst map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nmap1.equals(map2); \/\/ true\nmap1 === map2; \/\/ false\nNote: As a performance optimization Immutable.js attempts to return the existing\ncollection when an operation would result in an identical collection, allowing\nfor using === reference equality to determine if something definitely has not\nchanged. This can be extremely useful when used within a memoization function\nwhich would prefer to re-run the function if a deeper equality check could\npotentially be more costly. The === equality check is also used internally by\nImmutable.is and .equals() as a performance optimization.\nconst { Map } = require('immutable');\nconst map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst map2 = map1.set('b', 2); \/\/ Set to same value\nmap1 === map2; \/\/ true\nIf an object is immutable, it can be \"copied\" simply by making another reference\nto it instead of copying the entire object. Because a reference is much smaller\nthan the object itself, this results in memory savings and a potential boost in\nexecution speed for programs which rely on copies (such as an undo-stack).\nconst { Map } = require('immutable');\nconst map = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst mapCopy = map; \/\/ Look, \"copies\" are free!\nJavaScript-first API\nWhile Immutable.js is inspired by Clojure, Scala, Haskell and other functional\nprogramming environments, it's designed to bring these powerful concepts to\nJavaScript, and therefore has an Object-Oriented API that closely mirrors that\nof ES2015 Array, Map, and Set.\nThe difference for the immutable collections is that methods which would mutate\nthe collection, like push, set, unshift or splice, instead return a new\nimmutable collection. Methods which return new arrays, like slice or concat,\ninstead return new immutable collections.\nconst { List } = require('immutable');\nconst list1 = List([ 1, 2 ]);\nconst list2 = list1.push(3, 4, 5);\nconst list3 = list2.unshift(0);\nconst list4 = list1.concat(list2, list3);\nassert.equal(list1.size, 2);\nassert.equal(list2.size, 5);\nassert.equal(list3.size, 6);\nassert.equal(list4.size, 13);\nassert.equal(list4.get(0), 1);\nAlmost all of the methods on Array will be found in similar form on\nImmutable.List, those of Map found on Immutable.Map, and those of Set\nfound on Immutable.Set, including collection operations like forEach()\nand map().\nconst { Map } = require('immutable');\nconst alpha = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 });\nalpha.map((v, k) => k.toUpperCase()).join();\n\/\/ 'A,B,C,D'\nConvert from raw JavaScript objects and arrays.\nDesigned to inter-operate with your existing JavaScript, Immutable.js\naccepts plain JavaScript Arrays and Objects anywhere a method expects a\nCollection.\nconst { Map, List } = require('immutable');\nconst map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 });\nconst map2 = Map({ c: 10, a: 20, t: 30 });\nconst obj = { d: 100, o: 200, g: 300 };\nconst map3 = map1.merge(map2, obj);\n\/\/ Map { a: 20, b: 2, c: 10, d: 100, t: 30, o: 200, g: 300 }\nconst list1 = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);\nconst list2 = List([ 4, 5, 6 ]);\nconst array = [ 7, 8, 9 ];\nconst list3 = list1.concat(list2, array);\n\/\/ List [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]\nThis is possible because Immutable.js can treat any JavaScript Array or Object\nas a Collection. You can take advantage of this in order to get sophisticated\ncollection methods on JavaScript Objects, which otherwise have a very sparse\nnative API. Because Seq evaluates lazily and does not cache intermediate\nresults, these operations can be extremely efficient.\nconst { Seq } = require('immutable');\nconst myObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };\nSeq(myObject).map(x => x * x).toObject();\n\/\/ { a: 1, b: 4, c: 9 }\nKeep in mind, when using JS objects to construct Immutable Maps, that\nJavaScript Object properties are always strings, even if written in a quote-less\nshorthand, while Immutable Maps accept keys of any type.\nconst { fromJS } = require('immutable');\n\nconst obj = { 1: \"one\" };\nconsole.log(Object.keys(obj)); \/\/ [ \"1\" ]\nconsole.log(obj[\"1\"], obj[1]); \/\/ \"one\", \"one\"\n\nconst map = fromJS(obj);\nconsole.log(map.get(\"1\"), map.get(1)); \/\/ \"one\", undefined\nProperty access for JavaScript Objects first converts the key to a string, but\nsince Immutable Map keys can be of any type the argument to get() is\nnot altered.\nConverts back to raw JavaScript objects.\nAll Immutable.js Collections can be converted to plain JavaScript Arrays and\nObjects shallowly with toArray() and toObject() or deeply with toJS().\nAll Immutable Collections also implement toJSON() allowing them to be passed\nto JSON.stringify directly. They also respect the custom toJSON() methods of\nnested objects.\nconst { Map, List } = require('immutable');\nconst deep = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: List([ 3, 4, 5 ]) });\nconsole.log(deep.toObject()); \/\/ { a: 1, b: 2, c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] }\nconsole.log(deep.toArray()); \/\/ [ 1, 2, List [ 3, 4, 5 ] ]\nconsole.log(deep.toJS()); \/\/ { a: 1, b: 2, c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] }\nJSON.stringify(deep); \/\/ '{\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"c\":[3,4,5]}'\nEmbraces ES2015\nImmutable.js supports all JavaScript environments, including legacy\nbrowsers (even IE8). However it also takes advantage of features added to\nJavaScript in ES2015, the latest standard version of JavaScript, including\nIterators, Arrow Functions, Classes, and Modules. It's inspired\nby the native Map and Set collections added to ES2015.\nAll examples in the Documentation are presented in ES2015. To run in all\nbrowsers, they need to be translated to ES5.\n\/\/ ES2015\nconst mapped = foo.map(x => x * x);\n\/\/ ES5\nvar mapped = foo.map(function (x) { return x * x; });\nAll Immutable.js collections are Iterable, which allows them to be\nused anywhere an Iterable is expected, such as when spreading into an Array.\nconst { List } = require('immutable');\nconst aList = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);\nconst anArray = [ 0, ...aList, 4, 5 ]; \/\/ [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\nNote: A Collection is always iterated in the same order, however that order may\nnot always be well defined, as is the case for the Map and Set.\nNested Structures\nThe collections in Immutable.js are intended to be nested, allowing for deep\ntrees of data, similar to JSON.\nconst { fromJS } = require('immutable');\nconst nested = fromJS({ a: { b: { c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } });\n\/\/ Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } }\nA few power-tools allow for reading and operating on nested data. The\nmost useful are mergeDeep, getIn, setIn, and updateIn, found on List,\nMap and OrderedMap.\nconst { fromJS } = require('immutable');\nconst nested = fromJS({ a: { b: { c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } });\n\nconst nested2 = nested.mergeDeep({ a: { b: { d: 6 } } });\n\/\/ Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 6 } } }\n\nconsole.log(nested2.getIn([ 'a', 'b', 'd' ])); \/\/ 6\n\nconst nested3 = nested2.updateIn([ 'a', 'b', 'd' ], value => value + 1);\nconsole.log(nested3);\n\/\/ Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 7 } } }\n\nconst nested4 = nested3.updateIn([ 'a', 'b', 'c' ], list => list.push(6));\n\/\/ Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ], d: 7 } } }\nEquality treats Collections as Values\nImmutable.js collections are treated as pure data values. Two immutable\ncollections are considered value equal (via .equals() or is()) if they\nrepresent the same collection of values. This differs from JavaScript's typical\nreference equal (via === or ==) for Objects and Arrays which only\ndetermines if two variables represent references to the same object instance.\nConsider the example below where two identical Map instances are not\nreference equal but are value equal.\n\/\/ First consider:\nconst obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };\nconst obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };\nobj1 !== obj2; \/\/ two different instances are always not equal with ===\n\nconst { Map, is } = require('immutable');\nconst map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nmap1 !== map2; \/\/ two different instances are not reference-equal\nmap1.equals(map2); \/\/ but are value-equal if they have the same values\nis(map1, map2); \/\/ alternatively can use the is() function\nValue equality allows Immutable.js collections to be used as keys in Maps or\nvalues in Sets, and retrieved with different but equivalent collections:\nconst { Map, Set } = require('immutable');\nconst map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst set = Set().add(map1);\nset.has(map2); \/\/ true because these are value-equal\nNote: is() uses the same measure of equality as Object.is for scalar\nstrings and numbers, but uses value equality for Immutable collections,\ndetermining if both are immutable and all keys and values are equal\nusing the same measure of equality.\nPerformance tradeoffs\nWhile value equality is useful in many circumstances, it has different\nperformance characteristics than reference equality. Understanding these\ntradeoffs may help you decide which to use in each case, especially when used\nto memoize some operation.\nWhen comparing two collections, value equality may require considering every\nitem in each collection, on an O(N) time complexity. For large collections of\nvalues, this could become a costly operation. Though if the two are not equal\nand hardly similar, the inequality is determined very quickly. In contrast, when\ncomparing two collections with reference equality, only the initial references\nto memory need to be compared which is not based on the size of the collections,\nwhich has an O(1) time complexity. Checking reference equality is always very\nfast, however just because two collections are not reference-equal does not rule\nout the possibility that they may be value-equal.\nReturn self on no-op optimization\nWhen possible, Immutable.js avoids creating new objects for updates where no\nchange in value occurred, to allow for efficient reference equality checking\nto quickly determine if no change occurred.\nconst { Map } = require('immutable');\nconst originalMap = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst updatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 2);\nupdatedMap === originalMap; \/\/ No-op .set() returned the original reference.\nHowever updates which do result in a change will return a new reference. Each\nof these operations occur independently, so two similar updates will not return\nthe same reference:\nconst { Map } = require('immutable');\nconst originalMap = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst updatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 1000);\n\/\/ New instance, leaving the original immutable.\nupdatedMap !== originalMap;\nconst anotherUpdatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 1000);\n\/\/ Despite both the results of the same operation, each created a new reference.\nanotherUpdatedMap !== updatedMap;\n\/\/ However the two are value equal.\nanotherUpdatedMap.equals(updatedMap);\nBatching Mutations\n\nIf a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?\nIf a pure function mutates some local data in order to produce an immutable\nreturn value, is that ok?\n\u2014 Rich Hickey, Clojure\n\nApplying a mutation to create a new immutable object results in some overhead,\nwhich can add up to a minor performance penalty. If you need to apply a series\nof mutations locally before returning, Immutable.js gives you the ability to\ncreate a temporary mutable (transient) copy of a collection and apply a batch of\nmutations in a performant manner by using withMutations. In fact, this is\nexactly how  Immutable.js applies complex mutations itself.\nAs an example, building list2 results in the creation of 1, not 3, new\nimmutable Lists.\nconst { List } = require('immutable');\nconst list1 = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);\nconst list2 = list1.withMutations(function (list) {\n  list.push(4).push(5).push(6);\n});\nassert.equal(list1.size, 3);\nassert.equal(list2.size, 6);\nNote: Immutable.js also provides asMutable and asImmutable, but only\nencourages their use when withMutations will not suffice. Use caution to not\nreturn a mutable copy, which could result in undesired behavior.\nImportant!: Only a select few methods can be used in withMutations including\nset, push and pop. These methods can be applied directly against a\npersistent data-structure where other methods like map, filter, sort,\nand splice will always return new immutable data-structures and never mutate\na mutable collection.\nLazy Seq\nSeq describes a lazy operation, allowing them to efficiently chain\nuse of all the higher-order collection methods (such as map and filter)\nby not creating intermediate collections.\nSeq is immutable \u2014 Once a Seq is created, it cannot be\nchanged, appended to, rearranged or otherwise modified. Instead, any mutative\nmethod called on a Seq will return a new Seq.\nSeq is lazy \u2014 Seq does as little work as necessary to respond to any\nmethod call. Values are often created during iteration, including implicit\niteration when reducing or converting to a concrete data structure such as\na List or JavaScript Array.\nFor example, the following performs no work, because the resulting\nSeq's values are never iterated:\nconst { Seq } = require('immutable');\nconst oddSquares = Seq([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ])\n  .filter(x => x % 2 !== 0)\n  .map(x => x * x);\nOnce the Seq is used, it performs only the work necessary. In this\nexample, no intermediate arrays are ever created, filter is called three\ntimes, and map is only called once:\noddSquares.get(1); \/\/ 9\nAny collection can be converted to a lazy Seq with Seq().\nconst { Map, Seq } = require('immutable');\nconst map = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\nconst lazySeq = Seq(map);\nSeq allows for the efficient chaining of operations, allowing for the\nexpression of logic that can otherwise be very tedious:\nlazySeq\n  .flip()\n  .map(key => key.toUpperCase())\n  .flip();\n\/\/ Seq { A: 1, B: 2, C: 3 }\nAs well as expressing logic that would otherwise seem memory or time\nlimited, for example Range is a special kind of Lazy sequence.\nconst { Range } = require('immutable');\nRange(1, Infinity)\n  .skip(1000)\n  .map(n => -n)\n  .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)\n  .take(2)\n  .reduce((r, n) => r * n, 1);\n\/\/ 1006008\nDocumentation\nRead the docs and eat your vegetables.\nDocs are automatically generated from Immutable.d.ts.\nPlease contribute!\nAlso, don't miss the Wiki which\ncontains articles on specific topics.

Koa's middleware stack flows in a stack-like manner, allowing you to perform actions downstream then filter and manipulate the response upstream.\nOnly methods that are common to nearly all HTTP servers are integrated directly into Koa's small ~570 SLOC codebase. This\nincludes things like content negotiation, normalization of node inconsistencies, redirection, and a few others.\nKoa is not bundled with any middleware.\nInstallation\nKoa requires node v7.6.0 or higher for ES2015 and async function support.\n$ npm install koa\n\nHello Koa\nconst Koa = require('koa');\nconst app = new Koa();\n\n\/\/ response\napp.use(ctx => {\n  ctx.body = 'Hello Koa';\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\nGetting started\n\nKick-Off-Koa - An intro to Koa via a set of self-guided workshops.\nWorkshop - A workshop to learn the basics of Koa, Express' spiritual successor.\nIntroduction Screencast - An introduction to installing and getting started with Koa\n\nMiddleware\nKoa is a middleware framework that can take two different kinds of functions as middleware:\n\nasync function\ncommon function\n\nHere is an example of logger middleware with each of the different functions:\nasync functions (node v7.6+)\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => {\n  const start = Date.now();\n  await next();\n  const ms = Date.now() - start;\n  console.log(`${ctx.method} ${ctx.url} - ${ms}ms`);\n});\nCommon function\n\/\/ Middleware normally takes two parameters (ctx, next), ctx is the context for one request,\n\/\/ next is a function that is invoked to execute the downstream middleware. It returns a Promise with a then function for running code after completion.\n\napp.use((ctx, next) => {\n  const start = Date.now();\n  return next().then(() => {\n    const ms = Date.now() - start;\n    console.log(`${ctx.method} ${ctx.url} - ${ms}ms`);\n  });\n});\nKoa v1.x Middleware Signature\nThe middleware signature changed between v1.x and v2.x.  The older signature is deprecated.\nOld signature middleware support will be removed in v3\nPlease see the Migration Guide for more information on upgrading from v1.x and\nusing v1.x middleware with v2.x.\nContext, Request and Response\nEach middleware receives a Koa Context object that encapsulates an incoming\nhttp message and the corresponding response to that message.  ctx is often used\nas the parameter name for the context object.\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => { await next(); });\nKoa provides a Request object as the request property of the Context.\nKoa's Request object provides helpful methods for working with\nhttp requests which delegate to an IncomingMessage\nfrom the node http module.\nHere is an example of checking that a requesting client supports xml.\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => {\n  ctx.assert(ctx.request.accepts('xml'), 406);\n  \/\/ equivalent to:\n  \/\/ if (!ctx.request.accepts('xml')) ctx.throw(406);\n  await next();\n});\nKoa provides a Response object as the response property of the Context.\nKoa's Response object provides helpful methods for working with\nhttp responses which delegate to a ServerResponse\n.\nKoa's pattern of delegating to Node's request and response objects rather than extending them\nprovides a cleaner interface and reduces conflicts between different middleware and with Node\nitself as well as providing better support for stream handling.  The IncomingMessage can still be\ndirectly accessed as the req property on the Context and ServerResponse can be directly\naccessed as the res property on the Context.\nHere is an example using Koa's Response object to stream a file as the response body.\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => {\n  await next();\n  ctx.response.type = 'xml';\n  ctx.response.body = fs.createReadStream('really_large.xml');\n});\nThe Context object also provides shortcuts for methods on its request and response.  In the prior\nexamples,  ctx.type can be used instead of ctx.response.type and ctx.accepts can be used\ninstead of ctx.request.accepts.\nFor more information on Request, Response and Context, see the Request API Reference,\nResponse API Reference and Context API Reference.\nKoa Application\nThe object created when executing new Koa() is known as the Koa application object.\nThe application object is Koa's interface with node's http server and handles the registration\nof middleware, dispatching to the middleware from http, default error handling, as well as\nconfiguration of the context, request and response objects.\nLearn more about the application object in the Application API Reference.\nDocumentation\n\nUsage Guide\nError Handling\nKoa for Express Users\nFAQ\nAPI documentation\n\nTroubleshooting\nCheck the Troubleshooting Guide or Debugging Koa in\nthe general Koa guide.\nRunning tests\n$ npm test\n\nReporting vulnerabilities\nTo report a security vulnerability, please do not open an issue, as this notifies attackers of the vulnerability.

No Flash. Just 3kb gzipped.\n\n\nWhy\nCopying text to the clipboard shouldn't be hard. It shouldn't require dozens of steps to configure or hundreds of KBs to load. But most of all, it shouldn't depend on Flash or any bloated framework.\nThat's why clipboard.js exists.\nInstall\nYou can get it on npm.\nnpm install clipboard --save\n\nOr if you're not into package management, just download a ZIP file.\nSetup\nFirst, include the script located on the dist folder or load it from a third-party CDN provider.\n<script src=\"dist\/clipboard.min.js\"><\/script>\nNow, you need to instantiate it by passing a DOM selector, HTML element, or list of HTML elements.\nnew ClipboardJS('.btn');\nInternally, we need to fetch all elements that matches with your selector and attach event listeners for each one. But guess what? If you have hundreds of matches, this operation can consume a lot of memory.\nFor this reason we use event delegation which replaces multiple event listeners with just a single listener. After all, #perfmatters.\nUsage\nWe're living a declarative renaissance, that's why we decided to take advantage of HTML5 data attributes for better usability.\nCopy text from another element\nA pretty common use case is to copy content from another element. You can do that by adding a data-clipboard-target attribute in your trigger element.\nThe value you include on this attribute needs to match another's element selector.\n\n<!-- Target -->\n<input id=\"foo\" value=\"https:\/\/github.com\/zenorocha\/clipboard.js.git\">\n\n<!-- Trigger -->\n<button class=\"btn\" data-clipboard-target=\"#foo\">\n    <img src=\"assets\/clippy.svg\" alt=\"Copy to clipboard\">\n<\/button>\nCut text from another element\nAdditionally, you can define a data-clipboard-action attribute to specify if you want to either copy or cut content.\nIf you omit this attribute, copy will be used by default.\n\n<!-- Target -->\n<textarea id=\"bar\">Mussum ipsum cacilds...<\/textarea>\n\n<!-- Trigger -->\n<button class=\"btn\" data-clipboard-action=\"cut\" data-clipboard-target=\"#bar\">\n    Cut to clipboard\n<\/button>\nAs you may expect, the cut action only works on <input> or <textarea> elements.\nCopy text from attribute\nTruth is, you don't even need another element to copy its content from. You can just include a data-clipboard-text attribute in your trigger element.\n\n<!-- Trigger -->\n<button class=\"btn\" data-clipboard-text=\"Just because you can doesn't mean you should \u2014 clipboard.js\">\n    Copy to clipboard\n<\/button>\nEvents\nThere are cases where you'd like to show some user feedback or capture what has been selected after a copy\/cut operation.\nThat's why we fire custom events such as success and error for you to listen and implement your custom logic.\nvar clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');\n\nclipboard.on('success', function(e) {\n    console.info('Action:', e.action);\n    console.info('Text:', e.text);\n    console.info('Trigger:', e.trigger);\n\n    e.clearSelection();\n});\n\nclipboard.on('error', function(e) {\n    console.error('Action:', e.action);\n    console.error('Trigger:', e.trigger);\n});\nFor a live demonstration, go to this site and open your console.\nTooltips\nEach application has different design needs, that's why clipboard.js does not include any CSS or built-in tooltip solution.\nThe tooltips you see on the demo site were built using GitHub's Primer. You may want to check that out if you're looking for a similar look and feel.\nAdvanced Options\nIf you don't want to modify your HTML, there's a pretty handy imperative API for you to use. All you need to do is declare a function, do your thing, and return a value.\nFor instance, if you want to dynamically set a target, you'll need to return a Node.\nnew ClipboardJS('.btn', {\n    target: function(trigger) {\n        return trigger.nextElementSibling;\n    }\n});\nIf you want to dynamically set a text, you'll return a String.\nnew ClipboardJS('.btn', {\n    text: function(trigger) {\n        return trigger.getAttribute('aria-label');\n    }\n});\nFor use in Bootstrap Modals or with any other library that changes the focus you'll want to set the focused element as the container value.\nnew ClipboardJS('.btn', {\n    container: document.getElementById('modal')\n});\nAlso, if you are working with single page apps, you may want to manage the lifecycle of the DOM more precisely. Here's how you clean up the events and objects that we create.\nvar clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');\nclipboard.destroy();\nBrowser Support\nThis library relies on both Selection and execCommand APIs. The first one is supported by all browsers while the second one is supported in the following browsers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42+ \u2714\n12+ \u2714\n41+ \u2714\n9+ \u2714\n29+ \u2714\n10+ \u2714\n\n\n\nThe good news is that clipboard.js gracefully degrades if you need to support older browsers. All you have to do is show a tooltip saying Copied! when success event is called and Press Ctrl+C to copy when error event is called because the text is already selected.\nYou can also check if clipboard.js is supported or not by running ClipboardJS.isSupported(), that way you can hide copy\/cut buttons from the UI.\nBonus\nA browser extension that adds a \"copy to clipboard\" button to every code block on GitHub, MDN, Gist, StackOverflow, StackExchange, npm, and even Medium.\nInstall for Chrome and Firefox.\nLicense\nMIT License \u00a9 Zeno Rocha\n","74":"\nLeaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.\nWeighing just about 39 KB of gzipped JS plus 4 KB of gzipped CSS code, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.\nLeaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind.\nIt works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box,\ntaking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while being accessible on older ones too.\nIt can be extended with a huge amount of plugins,\nhas a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API\nand a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.\nFor more info, docs and tutorials, check out the official website.\nFor Leaflet downloads (including the built master version), check out the download page.\nWe're happy to meet new contributors.\nIf you want to get involved with Leaflet development, check out the contribution guide.\nLet's make the best mapping library that will ever exist,\nand push the limits of what's possible with online maps!\n\n","75":"\n\n  The Ultimate Open Source WebChat Platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW!

Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native apps by using 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development.\nAlong with the fantastic open source community, Phaser is actively developed and maintained by Photon Storm. As a result of rapid support, and a developer friendly API, Phaser is currently one of the most starred game frameworks on GitHub.\nThousands of developers from indie and multi-national digital agencies, and universities worldwide use Phaser. You can take a look at their incredible games.\nVisit: The Phaser website and follow on Twitter (#phaserjs)\nLearn: API Docs, Support Forum and StackOverflow\nCode: 1700+ Examples (source available in this repo)\nRead: The Phaser World Newsletter\nDiscord: Join us on Discord\nExtend: With Phaser Plugins\nBe awesome: Support the future of Phaser\nGrab the source and join the fun!\n\n\n\n13th July 2020\n\nI'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of Phaser 3.24. This release is primarily a maintenance release, with the focus mostly on bug fixes and updates. Even so, there are over 70 updates in this version alone. From improvements to the Arcade Physics system, to new Tween events and the ability to chain multiple animations, to some important fixes. If you're currently using 3.23 then we recommend this upgrade. As usual, I'd like to send my thanks to the Phaser community for their help in both reporting issues and submitting pull requests to fix them.\nSo, please do spend some time digging through the Change Log. I assure you, it's worth while :)\nI'd like to send a massive thank-you to everyone who supports Phaser on Patreon (and now even GitHub Sponsors, too!) Your continued backing keeps allowing me to work on Phaser full-time and this great new release is the very real result of that. If you've ever considered becoming a backer, now is the perfect time!\nAs well as all of these updates, development has been progressing rapidly on Phaser 4. If you'd like to stay abreast of developments then I'm now publishing them to the Phaser Patreon. Here you can find details about the latest developments and concepts behind Phaser 4.\nYou can also follow Phaser on Twitter and chat with fellow Phaser devs in our Discord.\nPhaser 3 wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic support of the community and Patreon. Thank you to everyone who supports our work, who shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phaser's role in that.\nHappy coding everyone!\nCheers,\nRich - @photonstorm\n\n\nBecause Phaser is an open source project, we cannot charge for it in the same way as traditional retail software. What's more, we don't ever want to. After all, it's built on, and was born from, open web standards. It's part of our manifesto that the core framework will always be free, even if you use it commercially, as many of you do.\nYou may not realize it, but because of this, we rely 100% on community backing to fund development.\nThose funds allow Phaser to improve, and when it improves, everyone involved benefits. Your support helps secure a constant cycle of updates, fixes, new features and planning for the future.\nThere are other benefits to backing Phaser, too:\n\nWe use Patreon to manage the backing and you can support Phaser from $1 per month. The amount you pledge is entirely up to you and can be changed as often as you like. Patreon renews monthly, just like Netflix. You can, of course, cancel at any point. Tears will be shed on this end, but that's not your concern.\nExtra special thanks to the following companies whose support makes Phaser possible:\n\nCerebral Fix\nCrossInstall\nFacebook\nGame Distribution\nGameCommerce\nMozilla\nTexture Packer\nTwilio\nPoki\nCrazyGames\nLagged\n\n\n\n\nPhaser 3 is available via GitHub, npm and CDNs:\n\nClone the git repository via https, ssh or with the GitHub Windows or Mac clients.\nDownload as zip\nDownload the build files: phaser.js and phaser.min.js\n\nNPM\nInstall via npm:\nnpm install phaser\nCDN\n\nPhaser is on jsDelivr which is a \"super-fast CDN for developers\". Include the following in your html:\n<script src=\"\/\/cdn.jsdelivr.net\/npm\/phaser@3.24.0\/dist\/phaser.js\"><\/script>\nor the minified version:\n<script src=\"\/\/cdn.jsdelivr.net\/npm\/phaser@3.24.0\/dist\/phaser.min.js\"><\/script>\nAPI Documentation\nGo to https:\/\/photonstorm.github.io\/phaser3-docs\/index.html to read the docs online. Use the drop-down menus at the top to navigate the namespaces, classes and Game Objects lists.\nOr, if you wish to run the docs locally you can checkout the phaser3-docs repository and then read the documentation by pointing your browser to the docs\/ folder.\nThe documentation for Phaser 3 is an on-going project. Please help us by searching the Phaser code for any instance of the string [description] and then replacing it with some documentation.\nTypeScript Definitions\nThe TypeScript definitions can be found inside the types folder. They are also referenced in the types entry in package.json.\nDepending on your project, you may need to add the following to your tsconfig.json file:\n\"typeRoots\": [\n    \".\/node_modules\/phaser\/types\"\n],\n\"types\": [\n    \"Phaser\"\n]\nWe recently published a new Phaser 3 TypeScript Project Template, which you can use to get started with if you like.\nThe TS defs are automatically generated from the JSDoc comments found in the Phaser source code. If you wish to help refine them then you must edit the Phaser JSDoc blocks directly, not the defs file. You can find more details about the parser we built in the scripts\/tsgen folder.\nWebpack\nWe use Webpack to build Phaser and we take advantage of its conditional build flag feature to handle renderer swapping. If you wish to use Webpack with Phaser then please use our Phaser 3 Project Template as it's already set-up to handle the build conditions Phaser needs. Recent changes to our build steps mean you should now be able to use any other packager, like Parcel, without any config changes.\nLicense\nPhaser is released under the MIT License.\n\n\n\nTutorials and guides on Phaser 3 development are being published every week.\n\nGetting Started with Phaser 3 (useful if you are completely new to Phaser)\nMaking your first Phaser 3 Game\nThe Complete Phaser 3 Game Development course contains over 15 hours of videos covering all kinds of important topics.\nPlus, there are over 700 Phaser tutorials listed on the official website.\n\nWe've 3 tutorials related specifically to creating Facebook Instant Games with Phaser:\n\nGetting Started with Facebook Instant Games\nFacebook Instant Games Leaderboards Tutorial\nDisplaying Ads in your Instant Games\n\nSource Code Examples\nDuring our development of Phaser 3, we created hundreds of examples with the full source code and assets ready available. These examples are now fully integrated into the Phaser website. You can also browse them on Phaser 3 Labs via a more advanced interface, or clone the examples repo. We are constantly adding to and refining these examples.\nHuge list of Phaser 3 Plugins\nSuper community member RexRainbow has been publishing Phaser 3 content for years, building up an impressive catalogue in that time. You'll find loads of plugins, from UI controls such as text input boxes, to Firebase support, Finite State Machines and lots more. As well as the plugins there is also a comprehensive set of 'Notes' about Phaser 3, going into great detail about how the various systems work. It's an invaluable resource and well worth checking out at https:\/\/rexrainbow.github.io\nCreate Your First Phaser 3 Example\nCreate an index.html page locally and paste the following code into it:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"https:\/\/cdn.jsdelivr.net\/npm\/phaser@3.24.0\/dist\/phaser-arcade-physics.min.js\"><\/script> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n\n    <script><\/script>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\nThis is a standard empty webpage. You'll notice there's a script tag that is pulling in a build of Phaser 3, but otherwise this webpage doesn't do anything yet. Now let's set-up the game config. Paste the following between the <script><\/script> tags:\nvar config = {\n    type: Phaser.AUTO,\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    physics: {\n        default: 'arcade',\n        arcade: {\n            gravity: { y: 200 }\n        }\n    },\n    scene: {\n        preload: preload,\n        create: create\n    }\n};\nconfig is a pretty standard Phaser 3 Game Configuration object. We tell config to use the WebGL renderer if it can, set the canvas to a size of 800x600 pixels, enable Arcade Physics, and finally call the preload and create functions. preload and create have not been implemented yet, so if you run this JavaScript code, you will have an error. Add the following after config:\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(config);\n\nfunction preload ()\n{\n    this.load.setBaseURL('http:\/\/labs.phaser.io');\n\n    this.load.image('sky', 'assets\/skies\/space3.png');\n    this.load.image('logo', 'assets\/sprites\/phaser3-logo.png');\n    this.load.image('red', 'assets\/particles\/red.png');\n}\n\nfunction create ()\n{\n}\ngame is a Phaser Game instance that uses our configuration object config. We also add function definitions for preload and create. The preload function helps you easily load assets into your game. In preload, we set the Base URL to be the Phaser server and load 3 PNG files.\nThe create function is empty, so it's time to fill it in:\nfunction create ()\n{\n    this.add.image(400, 300, 'sky');\n\n    var particles = this.add.particles('red');\n\n    var emitter = particles.createEmitter({\n        speed: 100,\n        scale: { start: 1, end: 0 },\n        blendMode: 'ADD'\n    });\n\n    var logo = this.physics.add.image(400, 100, 'logo');\n\n    logo.setVelocity(100, 200);\n    logo.setBounce(1, 1);\n    logo.setCollideWorldBounds(true);\n\n    emitter.startFollow(logo);\n}\nHere we add a sky image into the game and create a Particle Emitter. The scale value means that the particles will initially be large and will shrink to nothing as their lifespan progresses.\nAfter creating the emitter, we add a logo image called logo. Since logo is a Physics Image, logo is given a physics body by default. We set some properties for logo: velocity, bounce (or restitution), and collision with the world bounds. These properties will make our logo bounce around the screen. Finally, we tell the particle emitter to follow the logo - so as the logo moves, the particles will flow from it.\nRun it in your browser and you'll see the following:\n\n(Got an error? Here's the full code)\nThis is a tiny example, and there are hundreds more for you to explore, but hopefully it shows how expressive and quick Phaser is to use. With just a few easily readable lines of code, we've got something pretty impressive up on screen!\n\nOurcade have published two great Phaser 3 books. They'll take you from getting set-up, through to finishing your first game using modern JavaScript or TypeScript and they're both completely free! They also publish a huge range of quality tutorials and videos, so be sure to check out their site every week.\n\nThere are both plain and minified compiled versions of Phaser in the dist folder of the repository. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version is for production use. You can also create your own builds.\nCustom Builds\nPhaser 3 is built using Webpack and we take advantage of the Webpack definePlugin feature to allow for conditional building of the Canvas and WebGL renderers and extra plugins. You can custom the build process to only include the features you require. Doing so can cut the main build file size down to just 70KB.\nRead our comprehensive guide on creating Custom Builds of Phaser 3 for full details.\nBuilding from Source\nIf you wish to build Phaser 3 from source, ensure you have the required packages by cloning the repository and then running npm install on your source directory.\nYou can then run webpack to create a development build in the build folder which includes source maps for local testing. You can also npm run dist to create a minified packaged build in the dist folder. For a list of all commands available use npm run help.\n\n\nChange Log\nVersion 3.24 - Rem - 13th July 2020\nArcade Physics New Features, Updates and Fixes\n\nWhen colliding physics groups with the search tree enabled, there was an unnecessary intersection test for each body returned by the search (thanks @samme)\nWhen doing an overlap collision, there was an unnecessary intersection test for each pair of overlapping bodies (thanks @samme)\nSprite vs. Static Group collision tests now always use the static tree (thanks @samme)\nFixed a bug where if you added a static body to a sprite with scale \u2260 1, the body position was incorrect (thanks @samme)\nIf you passed in an array of children when creating a Physics Group, they didn't receive bodies. Fix #5152 (thanks @samme)\nNew types allow for better docs \/ TypeScript defs especially in the Factory functions: ArcadePhysicsCallback, GameObjectWithBody, GameObjectWithDynamicBody, GameObjectWithStaticBody, ImageWithDynamicBody, ImageWithStaticBody, SpriteWithDynamicBody and SpriteWithStaticBody. Fix #4994 (thanks @samme @gnesher)\nBody.updateFromGameObject is a new method that extracts the relevant code from preUpdate, allowing you to read the body's new position and center immediately, before the next physics step. It also lets refreshBody work for dynamic bodies, where previously it would error (thanks @samme)\nMomentum exchange wasn't working correctly vs. immovable bodies. The movable body tended to stop. Fix #4770 (thanks @samme)\nThe Body mass was decreasing the inertia instead of increasing it. Fix #4770 (thanks @samme)\nThe separation vector seemed to be incorrect, causing the slip \/ slide collisions. The separation is now correct for circle\u2013circle collisions (although not fully for circle\u2013rectangle collisions), part fix #4770 (thanks @samme)\nThe Arcade Body delta was incorrectly calculated on bodies created during the update step, causing the position to be off. Fix #5204 (thanks @zackexplosion @samme)\nArcade.Components.Size.setBodySize is a new method available on Arcade Physics Game Objects that allows you to set the body size. This replaces setSize which is now deprecated. Fix #4786 (thanks @wingyplus)\n\nNew Features\n\nThe Animation component has a new property nextAnimsQueue which allows you to sequence Sprite animations to play in order, i.e: this.mole.anims.play('digging').anims.chain('lifting').anims.chain('looking').anims.chain('lowering'); (thanks @tgroborsch)\nGroup.setActive is a new method that will set the active state of a Group, just like it does on other Game Objects (thanks @samme)\nGroup.setName is a new method that will set the name property of a Group, just like it does on other Game Objects (thanks @samme)\nTWEEN_STOP is a new event dispatched by a Tween when it stops playback (thanks @samme @RollinSafary)\nYou can now specify an onStop callback when creating a Tween as part of the tween config, which is invoked when a Tween stops playback (thanks @samme @RollinSafary)\nPreviously, if you created a timeline and passed no tweens in the config, the timeline would be created but all config properties were ignored. Now the timeline's own properties (completeDelay, loop, loopDelay, useFrames, onStart, onUpdate, onLoop, onYoyo, onComplete, etc.) are set from the config properly (thanks @samme)\nTextStyle.wordWrapWidth lets you set the maximum width of a line of text (thanks @mikewesthad)\nTextStyle.wordWrapCallback is a custom function that will is responsible for wrapping the text (thanks @mikewesthad)\nTextStyle.wordWrapCallbackScope is the scope that will be applied when the wordWrapCallback is invoked (thanks @mikewesthad)\nTextStyle.wordWrapUseAdvanced controls whether or not to use the advanced wrapping algorithm (thanks @mikewesthad)\nKeyboardPlugin.removeAllKeys is a new method that allows you to automatically remove all Key instances that the plugin has created, making house-keeping a little easier (thanks @samme)\nMath.RotateTo is a new function that will position a point at the given angle and distance (thanks @samme)\nDisplay.Bounds.GetBounds is a new function that will return the un-transformed bounds of the given Game Object as a Rectangle (thanks @samme)\n\nUpdates\n\nThe Pointer.dragStartX\/YGlobal and Pointer.dragX\/Y values are now populated from the worldX\/Y, which means using those values directly in Input Drag callbacks will now work when the Camera is zoomed. Fix #4755 (thanks @braindx)\nThe browser field has been added to the Phaser package.json pointing to the dist\/phaser.js umd build (thanks @FredKSchott)\nCalling TimeStep.wake() while the loop is running will now cause nothing to happen, rather than sleeping and then waking again (thanks @samme)\nContainer.getBounds will no longer set the temp rect bounds to the first child of the Container by default (which would error if the child had no bounds, like a Graphics object) and instead sets it as it iterates the children (thanks @blopa)\nFile.state will now be set to the FILE_LOADING state while loading and FILE_LOADED after loading (thanks @samme)\nBaseCamera.cull now moves some of its calculations outside of the cull loop to speed it up (thanks @samme)\nSceneManager.createSceneFromInstance had a small refactor to avoid a pointless condition (thanks @samme)\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFixed a TypeError warning when importing JSON objects directly to the url argument of any of the Loader filetypes. Fix #5189 (thanks @awweather @samme)\nThe NOOP function was incorrectly imported by the Mouse and Keyboard Manager. Fix #5170 (thanks @samme @gregolai)\nWhen Audio files failed to decode on loading, they would always show 'undefined' as the key in the error log, now they show the actual key (thanks @samme)\nWhen the Sprite Sheet parser results in zero frames, the warning will now tell you the texture name that caused it (thanks @samme)\nKeyboardPlugin.checkDown didn't set the duration to zero if the parameter was omitted, causing it to always return false. Fix #5146 (thanks @lozzajp)\nIf you passed in an array of children when creating a Group, they were not added and removed correctly. Fix #5151 (thanks @samme)\nWhen using HTML5 Audio with pauseOnBlur (the default), if you play a sound, schedule stopping the sound (e.g., timer, tween complete callback), leave the page, and return to the page, the sound stop() will error (thanks @samme)\nUsing a Render Texture when you're also using the headless renderer would cause an error (thanks @samme)\nEllipse.setWidth would incorrectly set the xRadius to the diameter (thanks @rexrainbow)\nEllipse.setHeight would incorrectly set the yRadius to the diameter (thanks @rexrainbow)\nWhen specifically setting the parent property in the Game Config to null the canvas was appended to the document body, when it should have been ignored (allowing you to add it to the dom directly). Fix #5191 (thanks @MerganThePirate)\nContainers will now apply nested masks correctly when using the Canvas Renderer specifically (thanks @scott20145)\nCalling Scale.startFullScreen would fail in Safari on Mac OS, throwing a fullscreenfailed error. It now triggers fullscreen mode correctly, as on other browsers. Fix #5143 (thanks @samme @novaknole)\nCalling setCrop on a Matter Physics Sprite would throw a TypeError, but will now crop correctly. Not that it only crops the texture, the body is unaffected. Fix #5211 (thanks @MatthewRorke @samme)\nThe Static Tilemap Layer would ignore the layer rotation and parent transform when using WebGL (but worked in Canvas). Both modes now work in the same manner (thanks @cruzdanilo)\nCalling getTextBounds on a BitmapText object would return the incorrect values if the origin had been changed, but the text itself had not, as it was using out of date dimensions. Changing the origin now automatically triggers BitmapText to be dirty, forcing the bounds to be refreshed. Fix #5121 (thanks @thenonamezz)\nThe ISO Triangle shape would skip rendering the left side of the first triangle in the batch. It now renders all ISO Triangles correctly. Fix #5164 (thanks @mattjennings)\n\nExamples, Documentation and TypeScript\nMy thanks to the following for helping with the Phaser 3 Examples, Docs and TypeScript definitions, either by reporting errors, fixing them or helping author the docs:\n@samme @SanderVanhove @SirJosh3917 @mooreInteractive @A-312 @lozzajp @mikewesthad @j-waters @futuremarc\nPlease see the complete Change Log for previous releases.\n\n\nThe Contributors Guide contains full details on how to help with Phaser development.

Major and Minor version releases are generally on a monthly schedule. Bugs fixes are addressed by severity and fixed as soon as possible.\nIf you require the absolute latest version of faker.js the master branch @ http:\/\/github.com\/marak\/faker.js\/ should always be up to date and working.\nMaintainer\nMarak Squires\nfaker.js - Copyright (c) 2020\nMarak Squires\nwww.marak.com\nhttp:\/\/github.com\/marak\/faker.js\/\nfaker.js was inspired by and has used data definitions from:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/stympy\/faker\/ - Copyright (c) 2007-2010 Benjamin Curtis\nhttp:\/\/search.cpan.org\/~jasonk\/Data-Faker-0.07\/ - Copyright 2004-2005 by Jason Kohles\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

when it comes to selecting an MV* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps.\nBackbone, Ember, AngularJS... the list of new and stable solutions goes on and on, but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?\nTo help solve this problem, we created TodoMVC - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks of today.\nTeam\nTodoMVC would not be possible without a strong team of contributors helping push the project forward each day. Additionally, we have a core project team composed of:\nAddy Osmani - Founder\/Lead\n\n  Addy is a Software Engineer at Google who originally created TodoMVC. He oversees the project direction, maintenance and organizes the planning and development efforts of the team.\nSindre Sorhus - Lead Developer\n\nSindre is a Web Developer who leads core development, quality control and application design for the project. His engineering contributions have helped us ensure consistency and best practices are enforced wherever possible.

Whilst we hope that this project can offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of a framework's potential capability.\nIt is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured, and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.\nAlso, please keep in mind that TodoMVC is not the perfect way to compare the size of different frameworks. We intentionally use the unminified versions to make reading the source code easier.\nGetting Involved\nWhilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework\/solution of choice.\nCheck out our contribution docs for more info.\nLicense\nEverything in this repo is MIT License unless otherwise specified.\nMIT \u00a9 Addy Osmani, Sindre Sorhus, Pascal Hartig, Stephen Sawchuk.\n","83":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript.

Among the existing resources, probably the most helpful question bank would be Front-end Developer Interview Questions. Unfortunately, I couldn't find many complete and satisfactory answers to these questions online, hence here is my attempt at answering them.

Equally, every programmer ought to\nknow how a compiler turns text into instructions, how a spreadsheet updates\ncells, and how a database efficiently persists data.\nPrevious books in the AOSA series have done this by describing the high-level\narchitecture of several mature open-source projects. While the lessons learned\nfrom those stories are valuable, they are sometimes difficult to absorb for\nprogrammers who have not yet had to build anything at that scale.\n\"500 Lines or Less\" focuses on the design decisions and tradeoffs that\nexperienced programmers make when they are writing code:\n\nWhy divide the application into these particular modules with these\nparticular interfaces?\nWhy use inheritance here and composition there?\nHow do we predict where our program might need to be extended, and how can\nwe make that easy for other programmers?\n\nEach chapter consists of a walkthrough of a program that solves a canonical\nproblem in software engineering in at most 500 source lines of code. We hope\nthat the material in this book will help readers understand the varied\napproaches that engineers take when solving problems in different domains, and\nwill serve as a basis for projects that extend or modify the contributions\nhere.\nContributors\n\n\nName\nAffiliation\nProject\nOnline\nGitHub\n\n\nMike DiBernardo\nWave\neditorial\n\n\n@mdibernardo\nmikedebo.ca\n\n\nMichaelDiBernardo\n\n\nAmy Brown\nindie\neditorial\namyrbrown.ca\n@amyrbrown\namyrbrown\n\n\nAllison Kaptur\nDropbox\nbyterun\n@akaptur\nakaptur\n\n\nAudrey Tang\ng0v.tw, Socialtext, Apple\nspreadsheet\n\n\n@audreyt\n\n\naudreyt\n\n\nBrandon Rhodes\nDropbox\ncontingent\n@brandon_rhodes\nbrandon-rhodes\n\n\nCarl Friedrich Bolz\nKing's College London\nobject model\n\n\ncfbolz.de\n@cfbolz\n\n\ncfbolz\n\n\nCate Huston\n\u00a0\nImage Filter app\n\n\nwww.accidentallyincode.com\/\n@catehstn\n\n\ncatehstn\n\n\nChristian Muise\nUniversity of Melbourne\nflow-shop\n\n\n@cjmuise\n\n\nhaz\n\n\nDaniel Jackson\n\u00a0\nsame-origin-policy\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nDaniel Rocco\nBrightLink Technology\ncontingent\n@drocco007\ndrocco007\n\n\nDann Toliver\nBento Box\ndagoba\n\n\ndanntoliver.com\n@dann\n\n\ndxnn\n\n\nDessy Daskalov\nNudge Rewards\nPedometer\n\n\nwww.dessydaskalov.com\n@dess_e\n\n\ndessy\n\n\nDethe Elza\n\u00a0\nblockcode\n\u00a0\ndethe\n\n\nDustin Mitchell\nMozilla\ncluster\n\u00a0\ndjmitche\n\n\nErick Dransch\n\u00a0\nModeller\n\n\n@ErickDransch\n\n\nEkkiD\n\n\nEunsuk Kang\n\u00a0\nsame-origin-policy\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nGreg Wilson\n\u00a0\nweb-server\n\n\n@gvwilson\n\n\ngvwilson\n\n\nGuido van Rossum\nDropbox\ncrawler\n\n\n@gvanrossum\n\n\ngvanrossum\n\n\nA.

Though the code's usually impressive, we saw room for improvement in the aesthetic department. Carbon makes it easy to create and share beautiful images of your source code. So what are you waiting for? Go impress all of your followers with your newfound design prowess.\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nCustomization. Customize things like your image's syntax theme, font style, and more\nShare quickly. Save your image or\na link with one click\nSave snippets. Create an account to save snippets for later. Shared snippets are automatically unfurled on Twitter and Slack.\n\nUsage\nImport\nThere are a few different ways to import code into Carbon:\n\nDrop a file onto the editor\nAppend a GitHub gist ID to the URL (e.g. carbon.now.sh\/<gist_id_goes_here>)\nOr just start typing!\n\nCustomization\nOnce you've got all of your code into Carbon, you can customize your image by changing the syntax theme, background color, window theme, padding, shadows, fonts, and more.\nExporting & Sharing\nAfter you've customized your image you can share your snippet in a number of ways\nCreate a saved snippet\nSharing a saved snippet will automatically unfurl the image on platforms like Twitter and Slack. This lets users see your creation, while also giving them access to the source code via the link. Better yet, if you need to make an update, simply follow the link yourself to edit the snippet directly.\nTo create a saved snippet:\n\nLogin using the \"Sign in\/Sign up\" button\nEdit as you normally would \u2014 your snippet will get saved automatically\nCopy the URL from your browser window and share away!\n\nEmbed a snippet\nThis is the recommended method for sharing Carbon on your own website or blog. Readers can even copy the code with the click of a button.\nYou can embed any Carbon snippet in your website directly using the carbon.now.sh\/embed URL. The \"Copy Menu\" lets you quickly copy the correct iFrame snippet, or the encoded URL for embedding on platforms like Medium.\nFinally, you can also embed saved snippets or GitHub gists using carbon.now.sh\/embed\/:id.\nUse the Tweet button\nThe Tweet button will not only share the image on Twitter, but it will also correctly encode the alt text to ensure your images are accessible. However, if you want to tweet image yourself, please check out how to make your Twitter images accessible.\nDownload the image directly\nCarbon supports downloading your image as a PNG and SVG. You can also click Export \u2192 Open to open your image directly in the browser. Finally, you can copy the Carbon image directly to your clipboard by going to Copy \u2192 Image.\nInstalling Carbon for Desktop (Offline)\nIf you are using Google Chrome, or another browser that supports Progressive Web Apps, you can install Carbon for use offline by:\n\nVisit carbon.now.sh\nClick your browser's settings menu\nClick \"Install Carbon...\"\n\nCommunity\nCheck out these projects our awesome community has created:\nEditor Plugins\n\nIntelliJ IDEA carbon-now-sh - Open up the selection in your current IntelliJ IDEA file in Carbon through a context menu\nAtom carbon-now-sh - Open up your current Atom file in Carbon with shift-cmd-A\nVS Code carbon-now-sh - Open up your current VS Code file in Carbon with command carbon\nSublime Text 3 carbon-now-sh - Open up the selection in your current Sublime Text 3 file with a custom bound key\nVim carbon-now-sh - Open up the selection in your current Vim\/Neovim using function CarbonNowSh()\nEmacs carbon-now-sh - Open up the selection in your current Emacs using interactive function carbon-now-sh\nXcode carbon-now-sh - Open up your current selection in carbon.now.sh\nXcode nef - This Xcode extension enables you to export a code selection as a Carbon snippet in a single action\n\nTools\n\nCLI carbon-now-cli - Open a file in Carbon or download it directly using carbon-now, featuring an interactive mode, selective highlighting and more\nCodeExpander - A smart GitHub gist client with the TextExpander features\nnef - Export multiple Carbon code snippets from Xcode Playground.\n@carbonshbot - A Telegram chatbot wich takes in a code snippet or gist URL and generates an Carbon image\nR carbonate - Iteratively manipulate image aesthetics in R and either open in Carbon or download directly.\n\nCitations\n\n\"CS 101 - An Introduction to Computational Thinking\" - a computer science textbook by Sarbo Roy.\n\nAuthors\nCarbon is a project by:\n\nMike Fix (@mfix22)\nBrian Dennis (@briandennis)\nJake Dexheimer (@jakedex)\n\nLicense\n\n\n\n\nContribute & Support\nPull requests are welcome!

The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format.\nNotes exported from Evernote via .enex files can be imported into Joplin, including the formatted content (which is converted to Markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.). Plain Markdown files can also be imported.\nThe notes can be synchronised with various cloud services including Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV or the file system (for example with a network directory). When synchronising the notes, notebooks, tags and other metadata are saved to plain text files which can be easily inspected, backed up and moved around.\nThe application is available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS (the terminal app also works on FreeBSD). A Web Clipper, to save web pages and screenshots from your browser, is also available for Firefox and Chrome.\n\nInstallation\nThree types of applications are available: for the desktop (Windows, macOS and Linux), for mobile (Android and iOS) and for terminal (Windows, macOS, Linux and FreeBSD). All applications have similar user interfaces and can synchronise with each other.\nDesktop applications\n\n\n\nOperating System\nDownload\nAlternative\n\n\n\n\nWindows (32 and 64-bit)\n\nOr get the Portable versionThe portable application allows installing the software on a portable device such as a USB key. Simply copy the file JoplinPortable.exe in any directory on that USB key ; the application will then create a directory called \"JoplinProfile\" next to the executable file.\n\n\nmacOS\n\nYou can also use Homebrew (unsupported): brew cask install joplin\n\n\nLinux\n\nAn Arch Linux package (unsupported) is also available.If it works with your distribution (it has been tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Mint; the desktop environments supported are GNOME, KDE, Xfce, MATE, LXQT, LXDE, Unity, Cinnamon, Deepin and Pantheon), the recommended way is to use this script as it will handle the desktop icon too: wget -O - https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/laurent22\/joplin\/dev\/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash\n\n\n\nMobile applications\n\n\n\nOperating System\nDownload\nAlt.

You may change this directory if needed. Alternatively, if your npm permissions are setup as described here (Option 2) then simply running npm -g install joplin would work.\n\n\n\nTo start it, type joplin.\nFor usage information, please refer to the full Joplin Terminal Application Documentation.\nUnsupported methods\nThere are other ways to install the terminal application. However, they are not supported and problems must be reported to the upstream projects.\n\n\n\nOperating system\nMethod\n\n\n\n\nmacOS\nbrew install joplin\n\n\nArch Linux\nAn Arch Linux package is available here. To install it, use an AUR wrapper such as yay: yay -S joplin. Both the CLI tool (type joplin) and desktop app (type joplin-desktop) are packaged. You can also install a compiled version with the chaotic-aur repository. For support, please go to the GitHub repo. If you are interested in pre-release you have joplin-beta.\n\n\n\nWeb Clipper\nThe Web Clipper is a browser extension that allows you to save web pages and screenshots from your browser.

In terms of data, the only two things that might slightly differ are:\n\n\nRecognition data - Evernote images, in particular scanned (or photographed) documents have recognition data associated with them. It is the text that Evernote has been able to recognise in the document. This data is not preserved when the note are imported into Joplin. However, should it become supported in the search tool or other parts of Joplin, it should be possible to regenerate this recognition data since the actual image would still be available.\n\n\nColour, font sizes and faces - Evernote text is stored as HTML and this is converted to Markdown during the import process. For notes that are mostly plain text or with basic formatting (bold, italic, bullet points, links, etc.) this is a lossless conversion, and the note, once rendered back to HTML should be very similar. Tables are also imported and converted to Markdown tables. For very complex notes, some formatting data might be lost - in particular colours, font sizes and font faces will not be imported. The text itself however is always imported in full regardless of formatting.\n\n\nTo import Evernote data, first export your Evernote notebooks to ENEX files as described here. Then follow these steps:\nIn the desktop application, open File > Import > ENEX and select your file. The notes will be imported into a new separate notebook. If needed they can then be moved to a different notebook, or the notebook can be renamed, etc.\nIn the terminal application, in command-line mode, type import \/path\/to\/file.enex. This will import the notes into a new notebook named after the filename.\nImporting from Markdown files\nJoplin can import notes from plain Markdown file. You can either import a complete directory of Markdown files or individual files.\nIn the desktop application, open File > Import > MD and select your Markdown file or directory.\nIn the terminal application, in command-line mode, type import --format md \/path\/to\/file.md or import --format md \/path\/to\/directory\/.\nImporting from other applications\nIn general the way to import notes from any application into Joplin is to convert the notes to ENEX files (Evernote format) and to import these ENEX files into Joplin using the method above. Most note-taking applications support ENEX files so it should be relatively straightforward. For help about specific applications, see below:\n\nStandard Notes: Please see this tutorial\nTomboy Notes: Export the notes to ENEX files as described here for example, and import these ENEX files into Joplin.\nOneNote: First import the notes from OneNote into Evernote. Then export the ENEX file from Evernote and import it into Joplin.\nNixNote: Synchronise with Evernote, then export the ENEX files and import them into Joplin. More info in this thread.\n\nExporting\nJoplin can export to the JEX format (Joplin Export file), which is a tar file that can contain multiple notes, notebooks, etc. This is a lossless format in that all the notes, but also metadata such as geo-location, updated time, tags, etc. are preserved. This format is convenient for backup purposes and can be re-imported into Joplin. A \"raw\" format is also available. This is the same as the JEX format except that the data is saved to a directory and each item represented by a single file.\nSynchronisation\nOne of the goals of Joplin was to avoid being tied to any particular company or service, whether it is Evernote, Google or Microsoft. As such the synchronisation is designed without any hard dependency to any particular service. Most of the synchronisation process is done at an abstract level and access to external services, such as Nextcloud or Dropbox, is done via lightweight drivers. It is easy to support new services by creating simple drivers that provide a filesystem-like interface, i.e. the ability to read, write, delete and list items. It is also simple to switch from one service to another or to even sync to multiple services at once. Each note, notebook, tags, as well as the relation between items is transmitted as plain text files during synchronisation, which means the data can also be moved to a different application, can be easily backed up, inspected, etc.\nCurrently, synchronisation is possible with Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive or the local filesystem. To enable synchronisation please follow the instructions below. After that, the application will synchronise in the background whenever it is running, or you can click on \"Synchronise\" to start a synchronisation manually.\nNextcloud synchronisation\n Nextcloud is a self-hosted, private cloud solution. It can store documents, images and videos but also calendars, passwords and countless other things and can sync them to your laptop or phone. As you can host your own Nextcloud server, you own both the data on your device and infrastructure used for synchronisation. As such it is a good fit for Joplin. The platform is also well supported and with a strong community, so it is likely to be around for a while - since it's open source anyway, it is not a service that can be closed, it can exist on a server for as long as one chooses.\nIn the desktop application or mobile application, go to the config screen and select Nextcloud as the synchronisation target. Then input the WebDAV URL (to get it, click on Settings in the bottom left corner of the page, in Nextcloud), this is normally https:\/\/example.com\/nextcloud\/remote.php\/webdav\/Joplin (make sure to create the \"Joplin\" directory in Nextcloud), and set the username and password. If it does not work, please see this explanation for more details.\nIn the terminal application, you will need to set the sync.target config variable and all the sync.5.path, sync.5.username and sync.5.password config variables to, respectively the Nextcloud WebDAV URL, your username and your password. This can be done from the command line mode using:\n:config sync.5.path https:\/\/example.com\/nextcloud\/remote.php\/webdav\/Joplin\n:config sync.5.username YOUR_USERNAME\n:config sync.5.password YOUR_PASSWORD\n:config sync.target 5\n\nIf synchronisation does not work, please consult the logs in the app profile directory - it is often due to a misconfigured URL or password. The log should indicate what the exact issue is.\nDropbox synchronisation\nWhen syncing with Dropbox, Joplin creates a sub-directory in Dropbox, in \/Apps\/Joplin and read\/write the notes and notebooks from it. The application does not have access to anything outside this directory.\nIn the desktop application or mobile application, select \"Dropbox\" as the synchronisation target in the config screen (it is selected by default). Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the \"Synchronise\" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.\nIn the terminal application, to initiate the synchronisation process, type :sync. You will be asked to follow a link to authorise the application. It is possible to also synchronise outside of the user interface by typing joplin sync from the terminal. This can be used to setup a cron script to synchronise at regular interval. For example, this would do it every 30 minutes:\n*\/30 * * * * \/path\/to\/joplin sync\n\nWebDAV synchronisation\nSelect the \"WebDAV\" synchronisation target and follow the same instructions as for Nextcloud above.\nWebDAV-compatible services that are known to work with Joplin:\n\nApache WebDAV Module\nDriveHQ\nFastmail\nHiDrive from Strato. Setup help\nNginx WebDAV Module\nNextcloud\nOwnCloud\nSeafile\nStack\nWebDAV Nav, a macOS server.\nZimbra\n\nOneDrive synchronisation\nWhen syncing with OneDrive, Joplin creates a sub-directory in OneDrive, in \/Apps\/Joplin and read\/write the notes and notebooks from it. The application does not have access to anything outside this directory.\nIn the desktop application or mobile application, select \"OneDrive\" as the synchronisation target in the config screen. Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the \"Synchronise\" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.\nIn the terminal application, to initiate the synchronisation process, type :sync. You will be asked to follow a link to authorise the application (simply input your Microsoft credentials - you do not need to register with OneDrive).\nEncryption\nJoplin supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on all the applications. E2EE is a system where only the owner of the notes, notebooks, tags or resources can read them. It prevents potential eavesdroppers - including telecom providers, internet providers, and even the developers of Joplin from being able to access the data. Please see the End-To-End Encryption Tutorial for more information about this feature and how to enable it.\nFor a more technical description, mostly relevant for development or to review the method being used, please see the Encryption specification.\nNote history\nThe Joplin applications automatically save previous versions of your notes at regular intervals. These versions are synced across devices and can be viewed from the desktop application. To do so, click on the \"Information\" button on a note, then click on \"Previous version of this note\". From this screen you can view the previous versions of the note as well as restore any of them.\nThis feature can be disabled from the \"Note history\" section in the settings, and it is also possible to change for how long the history of a note is saved.\nMore information about this feature in the announcement post.\nExternal text editor\nJoplin notes can be opened and edited using an external editor of your choice. It can be a simple text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text or an actual Markdown editor like Typora. In that case, images will also be displayed within the editor. To open the note in an external editor, click on the icon in the toolbar or press Ctrl+E (or Cmd+E). Your default text editor will be used to open the note. If needed, you can also specify the editor directly in the General Options, under \"Text editor command\".\nAttachments\nAny kind of file can be attached to a note. In Markdown, links to these files are represented as a simple ID to the attachment. In the note viewer, these files, if they are images, will be displayed or, if they are other files (PDF, text files, etc.) they will be displayed as links. Clicking on this link will open the file in the default application.\nIn the desktop application, files can be attached either by clicking the \"Attach file\" icon in the editor or via drag and drop. If you prefer to create a link to a local file instead, hold the ALT key while performing the drag and drop operation. You can also copy and paste images directly in the editor via Ctrl+V.\nResources that are not attached to any note will be automatically deleted in accordance to the Note History settings.\nImportant: Resources larger than 10 MB are not currently supported on mobile. They will crash the application when synchronising so it is recommended not to attach such resources at the moment. The issue is being looked at.\nDownloading attachments\nThe way the attachments are downloaded during synchronisation can be customised in the Configuration screen, under \"Attachment download behaviour\". The default option (\"Always\") is to download all the attachments, all the time, so that the data is available even when the device is offline. There is also the option to download the attachments manually (option \"Manual\"), by clicking on it, or automatically (Option \"Auto\"), in which case the attachments are downloaded only when a note is opened. These options should help saving disk space and network bandwidth, especially on mobile.\nNotifications\nIn the desktop and mobile apps, an alarm can be associated with any to-do. It will be triggered at the given time by displaying a notification. How the notification will be displayed depends on the operating system since each has a different way to handle this. Please see below for the requirements for the desktop applications:\n\nWindows: >= 8. Make sure the Action Center is enabled on Windows. Task bar balloon for Windows < 8. Growl as fallback. Growl takes precedence over Windows balloons.\nmacOS: >= 10.8 or Growl if earlier.\nLinux: notify-osd or libnotify-bin installed (Ubuntu should have this by default). Growl otherwise\n\nSee documentation and flow chart for reporter choice\nOn mobile, the alarms will be displayed using the built-in notification system.\nIf for any reason the notifications do not work, please open an issue.\nSub-notebooks\nSub-notebooks allow organising multiple notebooks into a tree of notebooks. For example it can be used to regroup all the notebooks related to work, to family or to a particular project under a parent notebook.\n\n\nIn the desktop application, to create a subnotebook, drag and drop it onto another notebook. To move it back to the root, drag and drop it on the \"Notebooks\" header. Currently only the desktop app can be used to organise the notebooks.\nThe mobile application supports displaying and collapsing\/expanding the tree of notebooks, however it does not currently support moving the subnotebooks to different notebooks.\nThe terminal app supports displaying the tree of subnotebooks but it does not support collapsing\/expanding them or moving the subnotebooks around.\n\nMarkdown\nJoplin uses and renders a Github-flavoured Markdown with a few variations and additions. In particular it adds math formula support, interactive checkboxes and support for note links. Joplin also supports Markdown plugins which allow enabling and disabling various advanced Markdown features. Have a look at the Markdown Guide for more information.\nCustom CSS\nRendered markdown can be customized by placing a userstyle file in the profile directory ~\/.config\/joplin-desktop\/userstyle.css (This path might be different on your device - check at the top of the Config screen for the exact path). This file supports standard CSS syntax. Joplin must be restarted for the new css to be applied, please ensure that Joplin is not closing to the tray, but is actually exiting. Note that this file is used for both displaying the notes and printing the notes. Be aware how the CSS may look printed (for example, printing white text over a black background is usually not wanted).\nThe whole UI can be customized by placing a custom editor style file in the profile directory ~\/.config\/joplin-desktop\/userchrome.css.\nImportant: userstyle.css and userchrome.css are provided for your convenience, but they are advanced settings, and styles you define may break from one version to the next. If you want to use them, please know that it might require regular development work from you to keep them working. The Joplin team cannot make a commitment to keep the application HTML structure stable.\nNote templates\nIn the desktop app, templates can be used to create new notes or to insert into existing ones by creating a templates folder in Joplin's config folder and placing Markdown template files into it. For example creating the file hours.md in the templates directory with the contents:\nDate: {{date}}\nHours:\nDetails:\nTemplates can then be inserted from the menu (File->Templates).\nThe currently supported template variables are:\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\n{{date}}\nToday's date formatted based on the settings format\n2019-01-01\n\n\n{{time}}\nCurrent time formatted based on the settings format\n13:00\n\n\n{{datetime}}\nCurrent date and time formatted based on the settings format\n01\/01\/19 1:00 PM\n\n\n{{#custom_datetime}}\nCurrent date and\/or time formatted based on a supplied string (using moment.js formatting)\n{{#custom_datetime}}M d{{\/custom_datetime}}\n\n\n{{bowm}}\nDate of the beginning of the week (when week starts on Monday) based on the settings format\n\n\n\n{{bows}}\nDate of the beginning of the week (when week starts on Sunday) based on the settings format\n\n\n\n\nSearching\nJoplin implements the SQLite Full Text Search (FTS4) extension. It means the content of all the notes is indexed in real time and search queries return results very fast. Both Simple FTS Queries and Full-Text Index Queries are supported. See below for the list of supported queries:\nSupported queries\n\n\n\nSearch type\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nSingle word\nReturns all the notes that contain this term.\nFor example, searching for cat will return all the notes that contain this exact word. Note: it will not return the notes that contain the substring - thus, for \"cat\", notes that contain \"cataclysmic\" or \"prevaricate\" will not be returned.\n\n\nMultiple word\nReturns all the notes that contain all these words, but not necessarily next to each other.\ndog cat - will return any notes that contain the words \"dog\" and \"cat\" anywhere in the note, no necessarily in that order nor next to each other. It will not return results that contain \"dog\" or \"cat\" only.\n\n\nPhrase\nAdd double quotes to return the notes that contain exactly this phrase.\n\"shopping list\" - will return the notes that contain these exact terms next to each other and in this order. It will not return for example a note that contains \"going shopping with my list\".\n\n\nPrefix\nAdd a wildcard to return all the notes that contain a term with a specified prefix.\nswim* - will return all the notes that contain eg. \"swim\", but also \"swimming\", \"swimsuit\", etc. IMPORTANT: The wildcard can only be at the end - it will be ignored at the beginning of a word (eg. *swim) and will be treated as a literal asterisk in the middle of a word (eg. ast*rix)\n\n\nSwitch to basic search\nOne drawback of Full Text Search is that it ignores most non-alphabetical characters. However in some cases you might want to search for this too. To do that, you can use basic search. You switch to this mode by prefixing your search with a slash \/. This won't provide the benefits of FTS but it will allow searching exactly for what you need. Note that it can also be much slower, even extremely slow, depending on your query.\n\/\"- [ ]\" - will return all the notes that contain unchecked checkboxes.\n\n\n\nSearch filters\nYou can also use search filters to further restrict the search.\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\n-\nIf placed before a text term, it excludes the notes that contain that term. You can also place it before a filter to negate it.\n-spam searches for all notes without the word spam.office -trash searches for all notes with the wordoffice and without the word trash.\n\n\nany:\nReturn notes that satisfy any\/all of the required conditions. any:0 is the default, which means all conditions must be satisfied.\nany:1 cat dog will return notes that have the word cat or dog.any:0 cat dog will return notes with both the words cat and dog.\n\n\ntitle:  body:\nRestrict your search to just the title or the body field.\ntitle:\"hello world\" searches for notes whose title contains hello and world.title:hello -body:world searches for notes whose title contains hello and body does not contain world.\n\n\ntag:\nRestrict the search to the notes with the specified tags.\ntag:office searches for all notes having tag office.tag:office tag:important searches for all notes having both office and important tags.tag:office -tag:spam searches for notes having tag office which do not have tag spam.any:1 tag:office tag:spam searches for notes having tag office or tag spam.tag:be*ful does a search with wildcards.tag:* returns all notes with tags.-tag:* returns all notes without tags.\n\n\nnotebook:\nRestrict the search to the specified notebook(s). It cannot be negated.\nnotebook:books limits the search scope within books and all its subnotebooks.notebook:wheel*time does a wildcard search.\n\n\ncreated:  updated:\nSearches for notes created\/updated on dates specified using YYYYMMDD format. You can also search relative to the current day, week, month, or year.\ncreated:20201218 will return notes created on or after December 18, 2020.-updated:20201218 will return notes updated before December 18, 2020.created:20200118 -created:20201215 will return notes created between January 18, 2020, and before December 15, 2020.created:202001 -created:202003 will return notes created on or after January and before March 2020.updated:1997 -updated:2020 will return all notes updated between the years 1997 and 2019.created:day-2 searches for all notes created in the past two days.updated:year-0 searches all notes updated in the current year.\n\n\ntype:\nRestrict the search to either notes or todos.\ntype:note to return all notestype:todo to return all todos\n\n\niscompleted:\nRestrict the search to either completed or uncompleted todos.\niscompleted:1 to return all completed todosiscompleted:0 to return all uncompleted todos\n\n\nlatitude:  longitude:  altitude:\nFilter by location\nlatitude:40 -latitude:50 to return notes with latitude >= 40 and < 50\n\n\nresource:\nFilter by attachment MIME type\nresource:image\/jpeg to return notes with a jpeg attachment.-resource:application\/pdf to return notes without a pdf attachment.resource:image\/* to return notes with any images.\n\n\nsourceurl:\nFilter by source URL\nsourceurl:https:\/\/www.google.comsourceurl:*joplinapp.org to perform a wildcard search.\n\n\n\nNote: In the CLI client you have to escape the query using -- when using negated filters.\nEg. :search -- \"-tag:tag1\".\nThe filters are implicitly connected by and\/or connectives depending on the following rules:\n\nBy default, all filters are connected by \"AND\".\nTo override this default behaviour, use the any filter, in which case the search terms will be connected by \"OR\" instead.\nThere's an exception for the notebook filters which are connected by \"OR\". The reason being that no note can be in multiple notebooks at once.\n\nSearch order\nNotes are sorted by \"relevance\". Currently it means the notes that contain the requested terms the most times are on top. For queries with multiple terms, it also matters how close to each other the terms are. This is a bit experimental so if you notice a search query that returns unexpected results, please report it in the forum, providing as many details as possible to replicate the issue.\nGoto Anything\nIn the desktop application, press Ctrl+G or Cmd+G and type a note title or part of its content to jump to it. Or type # followed by a tag name, or @ followed by a notebook name.\nPrivacy\nJoplin values your privacy and security by giving you complete control over your information and digital footprint.\nJoplin applications do not send any data to any service without your authorisation. Any data that Joplin saves, such as notes or images, are saved to your own device and you are free to delete this data at any time.\nJoplin has many modern features, some of which use third-party services.

It was originally designed for automating tasks across sites that don't have APIs, but is most often used for UI testing and crawling.\nUnder the covers it uses Electron, which is similar to PhantomJS but roughly twice as fast and more modern.\n\u26a0\ufe0f Security Warning: We've implemented many of the security recommendations outlined by Electron to try and keep you safe, but undiscovered vulnerabilities may exist in Electron that could allow a malicious website to execute code on your computer. Avoid visiting untrusted websites.\n\ud83d\udee0 Migrating to 3.x: You'll want to check out this issue before upgrading. We've worked hard to make improvements to nightmare while limiting the breaking changes and there's a good chance you won't need to do anything.\nNiffy is a perceptual diffing tool built on Nightmare.

Note that, even though goto normally waits for all the resources on a page to load, a timeout exception is only raised if the DOM itself has not yet loaded.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  gotoTimeout: 1000 \/\/ in ms\n})\nloadTimeout (default: infinite)\nForces Nightmare to move on if a page transition caused by an action (eg, .click()) didn't finish within the set timeframe. If loadTimeout is shorter than gotoTimeout, the exceptions thrown by gotoTimeout will be suppressed.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  loadTimeout: 1000 \/\/ in ms\n})\nexecutionTimeout (default: 30s)\nThe maximum amount of time to wait for an .evaluate() statement to complete.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  executionTimeout: 1000 \/\/ in ms\n})\npaths\nThe default system paths that Electron knows about. Here's a list of available paths: https:\/\/github.com\/atom\/electron\/blob\/master\/docs\/api\/app.md#appgetpathname\nYou can overwrite them in Nightmare by doing the following:\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  paths: {\n    userData: '\/user\/data'\n  }\n})\nswitches\nThe command line switches used by the Chrome browser that are also supported by Electron. Here's a list of supported Chrome command line switches:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/atom\/electron\/blob\/master\/docs\/api\/chrome-command-line-switches.md\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  switches: {\n    'proxy-server': '1.2.3.4:5678',\n    'ignore-certificate-errors': true\n  }\n})\nelectronPath\nThe path to the prebuilt Electron binary. This is useful for testing on different versions of Electron. Note that Nightmare only supports the version on which this package depends. Use this option at your own risk.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  electronPath: require('electron')\n})\ndock (OS X)\nA boolean to optionally show the Electron icon in the dock (defaults to false). This is useful for testing purposes.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  dock: true\n})\nopenDevTools\nOptionally shows the DevTools in the Electron window using true, or use an object hash containing mode: 'detach' to show in a separate window. The hash gets passed to contents.openDevTools() to be handled. This is also useful for testing purposes. Note that this option is honored only if show is set to true.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  openDevTools: {\n    mode: 'detach'\n  },\n  show: true\n})\ntypeInterval (default: 100ms)\nHow long to wait between keystrokes when using .type().\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  typeInterval: 20\n})\npollInterval (default: 250ms)\nHow long to wait between checks for the .wait() condition to be successful.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  pollInterval: 50 \/\/in ms\n})\nmaxAuthRetries (default: 3)\nDefines the number of times to retry an authentication when set up with .authenticate().\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  maxAuthRetries: 3\n})\ncertificateSubjectName\nA string to determine the client certificate selected by electron. If this options is set, the select-client-certificate event will be set to loop through the certificateList and find the first certificate that matches subjectName on the electron Certificate Object.\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  certificateSubjectName: 'tester'\n})\n.engineVersions()\nGets the versions for Electron and Chromium.\n.useragent(useragent)\nSets the useragent used by electron.\n.authentication(user, password)\nSets the user and password for accessing a web page using basic authentication. Be sure to set it before calling .goto(url).\n.end()\nCompletes any queue operations, disconnect and close the electron process. Note that if you're using promises, .then() must be called after .end() to run the .end() task. Also note that if using an .end() callback, the .end() call is equivalent to calling .end() followed by .then(fn). Consider:\nnightmare\n  .goto(someUrl)\n  .end(() => 'some value')\n  \/\/prints \"some value\"\n  .then(console.log)\n.halt(error, done)\nClears all queued operations, kills the electron process, and passes error message or 'Nightmare Halted' to an unresolved promise. Done will be called after the process has exited.\nInteract with the Page\n.goto(url[, headers])\nLoads the page at url. Optionally, a headers hash can be supplied to set headers on the goto request.\nWhen a page load is successful, goto returns an object with metadata about the page load, including:\n\nurl: The URL that was loaded\ncode: The HTTP status code (e.g. 200, 404, 500)\nmethod: The HTTP method used (e.g. \"GET\", \"POST\")\nreferrer: The page that the window was displaying prior to this load or an empty string if this is the first page load.\nheaders: An object representing the response headers for the request as in {header1-name: header1-value, header2-name: header2-value}\n\nIf the page load fails, the error will be an object with the following properties:\n\nmessage: A string describing the type of error\ncode: The underlying error code describing what went wrong. Note this is NOT the HTTP status code. For possible values, see https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromium\/codesearch#chromium\/src\/net\/base\/net_error_list.h\ndetails: A string with additional details about the error. This may be null or an empty string.\nurl: The URL that failed to load\n\nNote that any valid response from a server is considered \u201csuccessful.\u201d That means things like 404 \u201cnot found\u201d errors are successful results for goto. Only things that would cause no page to appear in the browser window, such as no server responding at the given address, the server hanging up in the middle of a response, or invalid URLs, are errors.\nYou can also adjust how long goto will wait before timing out by setting the gotoTimeout option on the Nightmare constructor.\n.back()\nGoes back to the previous page.\n.forward()\nGoes forward to the next page.\n.refresh()\nRefreshes the current page.\n.click(selector)\nClicks the selector element once.\n.mousedown(selector)\nMousedowns the selector element once.\n.mouseup(selector)\nMouseups the selector element once.\n.mouseover(selector)\nMouseovers the selector element once.\n.mouseout(selector)\nMouseout the selector element once.\n.type(selector[, text])\nEnters the text provided into the selector element. Empty or falsey values provided for text will clear the selector's value.\n.type() mimics a user typing in a textbox and will emit the proper keyboard events.\nKey presses can also be fired using Unicode values with .type(). For example, if you wanted to fire an enter key press, you would write .type('body', '\\u000d').\n\nIf you don't need the keyboard events, consider using .insert() instead as it will be faster and more robust.\n\n.insert(selector[, text])\nSimilar to .type(), .insert() enters the text provided into the selector element. Empty or falsey values provided for text will clear the selector's value.\n.insert() is faster than .type() but does not trigger the keyboard events.\n.check(selector)\nChecks the selector checkbox element.\n.uncheck(selector)\nUnchecks the selector checkbox element.\n.select(selector, option)\nChanges the selector dropdown element to the option with attribute [value=option]\n.scrollTo(top, left)\nScrolls the page to desired position. top and left are always relative to the top left corner of the document.\n.viewport(width, height)\nSets the viewport size.\n.inject(type, file)\nInjects a local file onto the current page. The file type must be either js or css.\n.evaluate(fn[, arg1, arg2,...])\nInvokes fn on the page with arg1, arg2,.... All the args are optional. On completion it returns the return value of fn. Useful for extracting information from the page. Here's an example:\nconst selector = 'h1'\nnightmare\n  .evaluate(selector => {\n    \/\/ now we're executing inside the browser scope.\n    return document.querySelector(selector).innerText\n  }, selector) \/\/ <-- that's how you pass parameters from Node scope to browser scope\n  .then(text => {\n    \/\/ ...\n  })\nError-first callbacks are supported as a part of evaluate(). If the arguments passed are one fewer than the arguments expected for the evaluated function, the evaluation will be passed a callback as the last parameter to the function. For example:\nconst selector = 'h1'\nnightmare\n  .evaluate((selector, done) => {\n    \/\/ now we're executing inside the browser scope.\n    setTimeout(\n      () => done(null, document.querySelector(selector).innerText),\n      2000\n    )\n  }, selector)\n  .then(text => {\n    \/\/ ...\n  })\nNote that callbacks support only one value argument (eg function(err, value)). Ultimately, the callback will get wrapped in a native Promise and only be able to resolve a single value.\nPromises are also supported as a part of evaluate(). If the return value of the function has a then member, .evaluate() assumes it is waiting for a promise. For example:\nconst selector = 'h1';\nnightmare\n  .evaluate((selector) => (\n    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      setTimeout(() => resolve(document.querySelector(selector).innerText), 2000);\n    )}, selector)\n  )\n  .then((text) => {\n    \/\/ ...\n  })\n.wait(ms)\nWaits for ms milliseconds e.g. .wait(5000).\n.wait(selector)\nWaits until the element selector is present e.g. .wait('#pay-button').\n.wait(fn[, arg1, arg2,...])\nWaits until the fn evaluated on the page with arg1, arg2,... returns true. All the args are optional. See .evaluate() for usage.\n.header(header, value)\nAdds a header override for all HTTP requests. If header is undefined, the header overrides will be reset.\nExtract from the Page\n.exists(selector)\nReturns whether the selector exists or not on the page.\n.visible(selector)\nReturns whether the selector is visible or not.\n.on(event, callback)\nCaptures page events with the callback. You have to call .on() before calling .goto(). Supported events are documented here.\nAdditional \"page\" events\n.on('page', function(type=\"error\", message, stack))\nThis event is triggered if any javascript exception is thrown on the page. But this event is not triggered if the injected javascript code (e.g. via .evaluate()) is throwing an exception.\n\"page\" events\nListens for window.addEventListener('error'), alert(...), prompt(...) & confirm(...).\n.on('page', function(type=\"error\", message, stack))\nListens for top-level page errors. This will get triggered when an error is thrown on the page.\n.on('page', function(type=\"alert\", message))\nNightmare disables window.alert from popping up by default, but you can still listen for the contents of the alert dialog.\n.on('page', function(type=\"prompt\", message, response))\nNightmare disables window.prompt from popping up by default, but you can still listen for the message to come up. If you need to handle the confirmation differently, you'll need to use your own preload script.\n.on('page', function(type=\"confirm\", message, response))\nNightmare disables window.confirm from popping up by default, but you can still listen for the message to come up. If you need to handle the confirmation differently, you'll need to use your own preload script.\n.on('console', function(type [, arguments, ...]))\ntype will be either log, warn or error and arguments are what gets passed from the console. This event is not triggered if the injected javascript code (e.g. via .evaluate()) is using console.log.\n.once(event, callback)\nSimilar to .on(), but captures page events with the callback one time.\n.removeListener(event, callback)\nRemoves a given listener callback for an event.\n.screenshot([path][, clip])\nTakes a screenshot of the current page. Useful for debugging. The output is always a png. Both arguments are optional. If path is provided, it saves the image to the disk. Otherwise it returns a Buffer of the image data. If clip is provided (as documented here), the image will be clipped to the rectangle.\n.html(path, saveType)\nSaves the current page as html as files to disk at the given path. Save type options are here.\n.pdf(path, options)\nSaves a PDF to the specified path. Options are here.\n.title()\nReturns the title of the current page.\n.url()\nReturns the url of the current page.\n.path()\nReturns the path name of the current page.\nCookies\n.cookies.get(name)\nGets a cookie by it's name. The url will be the current url.\n.cookies.get(query)\nQueries multiple cookies with the query object. If a query.name is set, it will return the first cookie it finds with that name, otherwise it will query for an array of cookies. If no query.url is set, it will use the current url. Here's an example:\n\/\/ get all google cookies that are secure\n\/\/ and have the path `\/query`\nnightmare\n  .goto('http:\/\/google.com')\n  .cookies.get({\n    path: '\/query',\n    secure: true\n  })\n  .then(cookies => {\n    \/\/ do something with the cookies\n  })\nAvailable properties are documented here: https:\/\/github.com\/atom\/electron\/blob\/master\/docs\/api\/session.md#sescookiesgetdetails-callback\n.cookies.get()\nGets all the cookies for the current url. If you'd like get all cookies for all urls, use: .get({ url: null }).\n.cookies.set(name, value)\nSets a cookie's name and value. This is the most basic form, and the url will be the current url.\n.cookies.set(cookie)\nSets a cookie. If cookie.url is not set, it will set the cookie on the current url. Here's an example:\nnightmare\n  .goto('http:\/\/google.com')\n  .cookies.set({\n    name: 'token',\n    value: 'some token',\n    path: '\/query',\n    secure: true\n  })\n  \/\/ ... other actions ...\n  .then(() => {\n    \/\/ ...\n  })\nAvailable properties are documented here: https:\/\/github.com\/atom\/electron\/blob\/master\/docs\/api\/session.md#sescookiessetdetails-callback\n.cookies.set(cookies)\nSets multiple cookies at once. cookies is an array of cookie objects. Take a look at the .cookies.set(cookie) documentation above for a better idea of what cookie should look like.\n.cookies.clear([name])\nClears a cookie for the current domain. If name is not specified, all cookies for the current domain will be cleared.\nnightmare\n  .goto('http:\/\/google.com')\n  .cookies.clear('SomeCookieName')\n  \/\/ ... other actions ...\n  .then(() => {\n    \/\/ ...\n  })\n.cookies.clearAll()\nClears all cookies for all domains.\nnightmare\n  .goto('http:\/\/google.com')\n  .cookies.clearAll()\n  \/\/ ... other actions ...\n  .then(() => {\n    \/\/...\n  })\nProxies\nProxies are supported in Nightmare through switches.\nIf your proxy requires authentication you also need the authentication call.\nThe following example not only demonstrates how to use proxies, but you can run it to test if your proxy connection is working:\nimport Nightmare from 'nightmare';\n\nconst proxyNightmare = Nightmare({\n  switches: {\n    'proxy-server': 'my_proxy_server.example.com:8080' \/\/ set the proxy server here ...\n  },\n  show: true\n});\n\nproxyNightmare\n  .authentication('proxyUsername', 'proxyPassword') \/\/ ... and authenticate here before `goto`\n  .goto('http:\/\/www.ipchicken.com')\n  .evaluate(() => {\n    return document.querySelector('b').innerText.replace(\/[^\\d\\.]\/g, '');\n  })\n  .end()\n  .then((ip) => { \/\/ This will log the Proxy's IP\n    console.log('proxy IP:', ip);\n  });\n\n\/\/ The rest is just normal Nightmare to get your local IP\nconst regularNightmare = Nightmare({ show: true });\n\nregularNightmare\n  .goto('http:\/\/www.ipchicken.com')\n  .evaluate(() =>\n    document.querySelector('b').innerText.replace(\/[^\\d\\.]\/g, '');\n  )\n  .end()\n  .then((ip) => { \/\/ This will log the your local IP\n    console.log('local IP:', ip);\n  });\nPromises\nBy default, Nightmare uses default native ES6 promises. You can plug in your favorite ES6-style promises library like bluebird or q for convenience!\nHere's an example:\nvar Nightmare = require('nightmare')\n\nNightmare.Promise = require('bluebird')\n\/\/ OR:\nNightmare.Promise = require('q').Promise\nYou can also specify a custom Promise library per-instance with the Promise constructor option like so:\nvar Nightmare = require('nightmare')\n\nvar es6Nightmare = Nightmare()\nvar bluebirdNightmare = Nightmare({\n  Promise: require('bluebird')\n})\n\nvar es6Promise = es6Nightmare\n  .goto('https:\/\/github.com\/segmentio\/nightmare')\n  .then()\nvar bluebirdPromise = bluebirdNightmare\n  .goto('https:\/\/github.com\/segmentio\/nightmare')\n  .then()\n\nes6Promise.isFulfilled() \/\/ throws: `TypeError: es6EndPromise.isFulfilled is not a function`\nbluebirdPromise.isFulfilled() \/\/ returns: `true | false`\nExtending Nightmare\nNightmare.action(name, [electronAction|electronNamespace], action|namespace)\nYou can add your own custom actions to the Nightmare prototype. Here's an example:\nNightmare.action('size', function(done) {\n  this.evaluate_now(() => {\n    const w = Math.max(\n      document.documentElement.clientWidth,\n      window.innerWidth || 0\n    )\n    const h = Math.max(\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight,\n      window.innerHeight || 0\n    )\n    return {\n      height: h,\n      width: w\n    }\n  }, done)\n})\n\nNightmare()\n  .goto('http:\/\/cnn.com')\n  .size()\n  .then(size => {\n    \/\/... do something with the size information\n  })\n\nRemember, this is attached to the static class Nightmare, not the instance.\n\nYou'll notice we used an internal function evaluate_now. This function is different than nightmare.evaluate because it runs it immediately, whereas nightmare.evaluate is queued.\nAn easy way to remember: when in doubt, use evaluate. If you're creating custom actions, use evaluate_now. The technical reason is that since our action has already been queued and we're running it now, we shouldn't re-queue the evaluate function.\nWe can also create custom namespaces. We do this internally for nightmare.cookies.get and nightmare.cookies.set. These are useful if you have a bundle of actions you want to expose, but it will clutter up the main nightmare object. Here's an example of that:\nNightmare.action('style', {\n  background(done) {\n    this.evaluate_now(\n      () => window.getComputedStyle(document.body, null).backgroundColor,\n      done\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nNightmare()\n  .goto('http:\/\/google.com')\n  .style.background()\n  .then(background => {\n    \/\/ ... do something interesting with background\n  })\nYou can also add custom Electron actions. The additional Electron action or namespace actions take name, options, parent, win, renderer, and done. Note the Electron action comes first, mirroring how .evaluate() works. For example:\nNightmare.action(\n  'clearCache',\n  (name, options, parent, win, renderer, done) => {\n    parent.respondTo('clearCache', done => {\n      win.webContents.session.clearCache(done)\n    })\n    done()\n  },\n  function(done) {\n    this.child.call('clearCache', done)\n  }\n)\n\nNightmare()\n  .clearCache()\n  .goto('http:\/\/example.org')\n  \/\/... more actions ...\n  .then(() => {\n    \/\/ ...\n  })\n...would clear the browser\u2019s cache before navigating to example.org.\nSee this document for more details on creating custom actions.\n.use(plugin)\nnightmare.use is useful for reusing a set of tasks on an instance. Check out nightmare-swiftly for some examples.\nCustom preload script\nIf you need to do something custom when you first load the window environment, you\ncan specify a custom preload script. Here's how you do that:\nimport path from 'path'\n\nconst nightmare = Nightmare({\n  webPreferences: {\n    preload: path.resolve('custom-script.js')\n    \/\/alternative: preload: \"absolute\/path\/to\/custom-script.js\"\n  }\n})\nThe only requirement for that script is that you'll need the following prelude:\nwindow.__nightmare = {}\n__nightmare.ipc = require('electron').ipcRenderer\nTo benefit of all of nightmare's feedback from the browser, you can instead copy the contents of nightmare's preload script.\nStorage Persistence between nightmare instances\nBy default nightmare will create an in-memory partition for each instance. This means that any localStorage or cookies or any other form of persistent state will be destroyed when nightmare is ended. If you would like to persist state between instances you can use the webPreferences.partition api in electron.\nimport Nightmare from 'nightmare';\n\nnightmare = Nightmare(); \/\/ non persistent paritition by default\nyield nightmare\n  .evaluate(() => {\n    window.localStorage.setItem('testing', 'This will not be persisted');\n  })\n  .end();\n\nnightmare = Nightmare({\n  webPreferences: {\n    partition: 'persist: testing'\n  }\n});\nyield nightmare\n  .evaluate(() => {\n    window.localStorage.setItem('testing', 'This is persisted for other instances with the same paritition name');\n  })\n  .end();\nIf you specify a null paritition then it will use the electron default behavior (persistent) or any string that starts with 'persist:' will persist under that partition name, any other string will result in in-memory only storage.\nUsage\nInstallation\nNightmare is a Node.js module, so you'll need to have Node.js installed. Then you just need to npm install the module:\n$ npm install --save nightmare\nExecution\nNightmare is a node module that can be used in a Node.js script or module. Here's a simple script to open a web page:\nimport Nightmare from 'nightmare';\n\nconst nightmare = Nightmare();\n\nnightmare.goto('http:\/\/cnn.com')\n  .evaluate(() => {\n    return document.title;\n  })\n  .end()\n  .then((title) => {\n    console.log(title);\n  })\nIf you save this as cnn.js, you can run it on the command line like this:\nnpm install --save nightmare\nnode cnn.js\nCommon Execution Problems\nNightmare heavily relies on Electron for heavy lifting. And Electron in turn relies on several UI-focused dependencies (eg. libgtk+) which are often missing from server distros.\nFor help running nightmare on your server distro check out How to run nightmare on Amazon Linux and CentOS guide.\nDebugging\nThere are three good ways to get more information about what's happening inside the headless browser:\n\nUse the DEBUG=* flag described below.\nPass { show: true } to the nightmare constructor to have it create a visible, rendered window where you can watch what is happening.\nListen for specific events.\n\nTo run the same file with debugging output, run it like this DEBUG=nightmare node cnn.js (on Windows use set DEBUG=nightmare & node cnn.js).\nThis will print out some additional information about what's going on:\nnightmare queueing action \"goto\" +0ms\nnightmare queueing action \"evaluate\" +4ms\nBreaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News - CNN.com\nDebug Flags\nAll nightmare messages\nDEBUG=nightmare*\nOnly actions\nDEBUG=nightmare:actions*\nOnly logs\nDEBUG=nightmare:log*\nAdditional Resources\n\n\nRoss Hinkley's Nightmare Examples is a great resource for setting up nightmare, learning about custom actions, and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n\nNightmare Issues has a bunch of standalone runnable examples. The script numbers correspond to nightmare issue numbers.\n\n\nNightmarishly good scraping is a great tutorial by \u00c6ndrew Rininsland on getting up & running with Nightmare using real-life data.\n\n\nTests\nAutomated tests for nightmare itself are run using Mocha and Chai, both of which will be installed via npm install. To run nightmare's tests, just run make test.\nWhen the tests are done, you'll see something like this:\nmake test\n  \u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\u2024\n  18 passing (1m)\nNote that if you are using xvfb, make test will automatically run the tests under an xvfb-run wrapper. If you are planning to run the tests headlessly without running xvfb first, set the HEADLESS environment variable to 0.\nLicense (MIT)\nWWWWWW||WWWWWW\n W W W||W W W\n      ||\n    ( OO )__________\n     \/  |           \\\n    \/o o|    MIT     \\\n    \\___\/||_||__||_|| *\n         || ||  || ||\n        _||_|| _||_||\n       (__|__|(__|__|\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Segment.io, Inc. mailto:friends@segment.com\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

\n\nFeatures\n\n\ud83d\udcfc HTML Video & Audio, YouTube & Vimeo - support for the major formats\n\ud83d\udcaa Accessible - full support for VTT captions and screen readers\n\ud83d\udd27 Customizable - make the player look how you want with the markup you want\n\ud83d\ude0e Clean HTML - uses the right elements. <input type=\"range\"> for volume and <progress> for progress and well, <button>s for buttons. There's no\n<span> or <a href=\"#\"> button hacks\n\ud83d\udcf1 Responsive - works with any screen size\n\ud83d\udcb5 Monetization - make money from your videos\n\ud83d\udcf9 Streaming - support for hls.js, Shaka and dash.js streaming playback\n\ud83c\udf9b API - toggle playback, volume, seeking, and more through a standardized API\n\ud83c\udfa4 Events - no messing around with Vimeo and YouTube APIs, all events are standardized across formats\n\ud83d\udd0e Fullscreen - supports native fullscreen with fallback to \"full window\" modes\n\u2328\ufe0f Shortcuts - supports keyboard shortcuts\n\ud83d\udda5 Picture-in-Picture - supports picture-in-picture mode\n\ud83d\udcf1 Playsinline - supports the playsinline attribute\n\ud83c\udfce Speed controls - adjust speed on the fly\n\ud83d\udcd6 Multiple captions - support for multiple caption tracks\n\ud83c\udf0e i18n support - support for internationalization of controls\n\ud83d\udc4c Preview thumbnails - support for displaying preview thumbnails\n\ud83e\udd1f No frameworks - written in \"vanilla\" ES6 JavaScript, no jQuery required\n\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f SASS - to include in your build processes\n\nDemos\nYou can try Plyr in Codepen using our minimal templates: HTML5 video, HTML5 audio, YouTube, Vimeo. For Streaming we also have example integrations with: Dash.js, Hls.js and Shaka Player\nQuick setup\nHTML\nPlyr extends upon the standard HTML5 media element markup so that's all you need for those types.\nHTML5 Video\n<video id=\"player\" playsinline controls data-poster=\"\/path\/to\/poster.jpg\">\n  <source src=\"\/path\/to\/video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\" \/>\n  <source src=\"\/path\/to\/video.webm\" type=\"video\/webm\" \/>\n\n  <!-- Captions are optional -->\n  <track kind=\"captions\" label=\"English captions\" src=\"\/path\/to\/captions.vtt\" srclang=\"en\" default \/>\n<\/video>\nNote: The poster image should be specified using data-poster. This is to prevent it being downloaded twice. If you're sure the image will be cached, you can still use the poster attribute for true progressive enhancement.\nHTML5 Audio\n<audio id=\"player\" controls>\n  <source src=\"\/path\/to\/audio.mp3\" type=\"audio\/mp3\" \/>\n  <source src=\"\/path\/to\/audio.ogg\" type=\"audio\/ogg\" \/>\n<\/audio>\nFor YouTube and Vimeo players, Plyr uses progressive enhancement to enhance the default <iframe> embeds. Below are some examples. The plyr__video-embed classname will make the embed responsive. You can add the autoplay, loop, hl (YouTube only) and playsinline (YouTube only) query parameters to the URL and they will be set as config options automatically. For YouTube, the origin should be updated to reflect the domain you're hosting the embed on, or you can opt to omit it.\nYouTube\nWe recommend progressive enhancement with the embedded players. You can elect to use an <iframe> as the source element (which Plyr will progressively enhance) or a bog standard <div> with two essential data attributes - data-plyr-provider and data-plyr-embed-id.\n<div class=\"plyr__video-embed\" id=\"player\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bTqVqk7FSmY?origin=https:\/\/plyr.io&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1\"\n    allowfullscreen\n    allowtransparency\n    allow=\"autoplay\"\n  ><\/iframe>\n<\/div>\nNote: The plyr__video-embed classname will make the player a responsive 16:9 (most common) iframe embed. When plyr itself kicks in, your custom ratio config option will be used.\nOr the <div> non progressively enhanced method:\n<div id=\"player\" data-plyr-provider=\"youtube\" data-plyr-embed-id=\"bTqVqk7FSmY\"><\/div>\nNote: The data-plyr-embed-id can either be the video ID or URL for the media.\nVimeo\nMuch the same as YouTube above.\n<div class=\"plyr__video-embed\" id=\"player\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/76979871?loop=false&amp;byline=false&amp;portrait=false&amp;title=false&amp;speed=true&amp;transparent=0&amp;gesture=media\"\n    allowfullscreen\n    allowtransparency\n    allow=\"autoplay\"\n  ><\/iframe>\n<\/div>\nOr the <div> non progressively enhanced method:\n<div id=\"player\" data-plyr-provider=\"vimeo\" data-plyr-embed-id=\"76979871\"><\/div>\nJavaScript\nYou can use Plyr as an ES6 module as follows:\nimport Plyr from 'plyr';\n\nconst player = new Plyr('#player');\nAlternatively you can include the plyr.js script before the closing <\/body> tag and then in your JS create a new instance of Plyr as below.\n<script src=\"path\/to\/plyr.js\"><\/script>\n<script>\n  const player = new Plyr('#player');\n<\/script>\nSee initialising for more information on advanced setups.\nYou can use our CDN (provided by Fastly) for the JavaScript. There's 2 versions; one with and one without polyfills. My recommendation would be to manage polyfills seperately as part of your application but to make life easier you can use the polyfilled build.\n<script src=\"https:\/\/cdn.plyr.io\/3.6.3\/plyr.js\"><\/script>\n...or...\n<script src=\"https:\/\/cdn.plyr.io\/3.6.3\/plyr.polyfilled.js\"><\/script>\nCSS\nInclude the plyr.css stylsheet into your <head>.\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path\/to\/plyr.css\" \/>\nIf you want to use our CDN (provided by Fastly) for the default CSS, you can use the following:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https:\/\/cdn.plyr.io\/3.6.3\/plyr.css\" \/>\nSVG Sprite\nThe SVG sprite is loaded automatically from our CDN (provided by Fastly). To change this, see the options below.

The SASS requires you to\nuse autoprefixer (you should be already!) as all declarations use the W3C definitions.\nThe HTML markup uses the BEM methodology with plyr as the block, e.g. .plyr__controls. You can change the class hooks in the options to match any custom CSS\nyou write. Check out the JavaScript source for more on this.\nSVG\nThe icons used in the Plyr controls are loaded in an SVG sprite. The sprite is automatically loaded from our CDN by default. If you already have an icon build\nsystem in place, you can include the source plyr icons (see \/src\/sprite for source icons).\nUsing the iconUrl option\nYou can however specify your own iconUrl option and Plyr will determine if the url is absolute and requires loading by AJAX\/CORS due to current browser\nlimitations or if it's a relative path, just use the path directly.\nIf you're using the <base> tag on your site, you may need to use something like this: svgfixer.js\nMore info on SVG sprites here: http:\/\/css-tricks.com\/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts\/ and the AJAX\ntechnique here: http:\/\/css-tricks.com\/ajaxing-svg-sprite\/\nCross Origin (CORS)\nYou'll notice the crossorigin attribute on the example <video> elements. This is because the TextTrack captions are loaded from another domain. If your\nTextTrack captions are also hosted on another domain, you will need to add this attribute and make sure your host has the correct headers setup. For more info\non CORS checkout the MDN docs:\nhttps:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Access_control_CORS\nCaptions\nWebVTT captions are supported. To add a caption track, check the HTML example above and look for the <track> element. Be sure to\nvalidate your caption files.\nJavaScript\nInitialising\nYou can specify a range of arguments for the constructor to use:\n\nA CSS string selector\nA HTMLElement\nA jQuery object\n\nNote: If a NodeList, Array, or jQuery object are passed, the first element will be used for setup. To setup multiple players, see multiple players below.\nSingle player\nPassing a CSS string selector that's compatible with querySelector:\nconst player = new Plyr('#player');\nPassing a HTMLElement:\nconst player = new Plyr(document.getElementById('player'));\nconst player = new Plyr(document.querySelector('.js-player'));\nThe HTMLElement or string selector can be the target <video>, <audio>, or <div> wrapper for embeds.\nMultiple players\nYou have two choices here. You can either use a simple array loop to map the constructor:\nconst players = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.js-player')).map(p => new Plyr(p));\n...or use a static method where you can pass a CSS string selector, a NodeList, an Array of HTMLElement, or a JQuery object:\nconst players = Plyr.setup('.js-player');\nBoth options will also return an array of instances in the order of they were in the DOM for the string selector or the source NodeList or Array.\nOptions\nThe second argument for the constructor is the options object:\nconst player = new Plyr('#player', {\n  title: 'Example Title',\n});\nOptions can be passed as an object to the constructor as above or as JSON in data-plyr-config attribute on each of your target elements:\n<video src=\"\/path\/to\/video.mp4\" id=\"player\" controls data-plyr-config='{ \"title\": \"Example Title\" }'><\/video>\nNote the single quotes encapsulating the JSON and double quotes on the object keys. Only string values need double quotes.\n\n\n\nOption\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nenabled\nBoolean\ntrue\nCompletely disable Plyr. This would allow you to do a User Agent check or similar to programmatically enable or disable Plyr for a certain UA. Example below.\n\n\ndebug\nBoolean\nfalse\nDisplay debugging information in the console\n\n\ncontrols\nArray, Function or Element\n['play-large', 'play', 'progress', 'current-time', 'mute', 'volume', 'captions', 'settings', 'pip', 'airplay', 'fullscreen']\nIf a function is passed, it is assumed your method will return either an element or HTML string for the controls. Three arguments will be passed to your function; id (the unique id for the player), seektime (the seektime step in seconds), and title (the media title). See CONTROLS.md for more info on how the html needs to be structured.\n\n\nsettings\nArray\n['captions', 'quality', 'speed', 'loop']\nIf the default controls are used, you can specify which settings to show in the menu\n\n\ni18n\nObject\nSee defaults.js\nUsed for internationalization (i18n) of the text within the UI.\n\n\nloadSprite\nBoolean\ntrue\nLoad the SVG sprite specified as the iconUrl option (if a URL). If false, it is assumed you are handling sprite loading yourself.\n\n\niconUrl\nString\nnull\nSpecify a URL or path to the SVG sprite. See the SVG section for more info.\n\n\niconPrefix\nString\nplyr\nSpecify the id prefix for the icons used in the default controls (e.g. \"plyr-play\" would be \"plyr\"). This is to prevent clashes if you're using your own SVG sprite but with the default controls. Most people can ignore this option.\n\n\nblankVideo\nString\nhttps:\/\/cdn.plyr.io\/static\/blank.mp4\nSpecify a URL or path to a blank video file used to properly cancel network requests.\n\n\nautoplay\u00b2\nBoolean\nfalse\nAutoplay the media on load. If the autoplay attribute is present on a <video> or <audio> element, this will be automatically set to true.\n\n\nautopause\u00b9\nBoolean\ntrue\nOnly allow one player playing at once.\n\n\nseekTime\nNumber\n10\nThe time, in seconds, to seek when a user hits fast forward or rewind.\n\n\nvolume\nNumber\n1\nA number, between 0 and 1, representing the initial volume of the player.\n\n\nmuted\nBoolean\nfalse\nWhether to start playback muted. If the muted attribute is present on a <video> or <audio> element, this will be automatically set to true.\n\n\nclickToPlay\nBoolean\ntrue\nClick (or tap) of the video container will toggle play\/pause.\n\n\ndisableContextMenu\nBoolean\ntrue\nDisable right click menu on video to help as very primitive obfuscation to prevent downloads of content.\n\n\nhideControls\nBoolean\ntrue\nHide video controls automatically after 2s of no mouse or focus movement, on control element blur (tab out), on playback start or entering fullscreen. As soon as the mouse is moved, a control element is focused or playback is paused, the controls reappear instantly.\n\n\nresetOnEnd\nBoolean\nfalse\nReset the playback to the start once playback is complete.\n\n\nkeyboard\nObject\n{ focused: true, global: false }\nEnable keyboard shortcuts for focused players only or globally\n\n\ntooltips\nObject\n{ controls: false, seek: true }\ncontrols: Display control labels as tooltips on :hover & :focus (by default, the labels are screen reader only). seek: Display a seek tooltip to indicate on click where the media would seek to.\n\n\nduration\nNumber\nnull\nSpecify a custom duration for media.\n\n\ndisplayDuration\nBoolean\ntrue\nDisplays the duration of the media on the \"metadataloaded\" event (on startup) in the current time display. This will only work if the preload attribute is not set to none (or is not set at all) and you choose not to display the duration (see controls option).\n\n\ninvertTime\nBoolean\ntrue\nDisplay the current time as a countdown rather than an incremental counter.\n\n\ntoggleInvert\nBoolean\ntrue\nAllow users to click to toggle the above.\n\n\nlisteners\nObject\nnull\nAllows binding of event listeners to the controls before the default handlers. See the defaults.js for available listeners. If your handler prevents default on the event (event.preventDefault()), the default handler will not fire.\n\n\ncaptions\nObject\n{ active: false, language: 'auto', update: false }\nactive: Toggles if captions should be active by default. language: Sets the default language to load (if available). 'auto' uses the browser language. update: Listen to changes to tracks and update menu. This is needed for some streaming libraries, but can result in unselectable language options).\n\n\nfullscreen\nObject\n{ enabled: true, fallback: true, iosNative: false, container: null }\nenabled: Toggles whether fullscreen should be enabled. fallback: Allow fallback to a full-window solution (true\/false\/'force'). iosNative: whether to use native iOS fullscreen when entering fullscreen (no custom controls). container: A selector for an ancestor of the player element, allows contextual content to remain visual in fullscreen mode. Non-ancestors are ignored.\n\n\nratio\nString\nnull\nForce an aspect ratio for all videos. The format is 'w:h' - e.g. '16:9' or '4:3'. If this is not specified then the default for HTML5 and Vimeo is to use the native resolution of the video. As dimensions are not available from YouTube via SDK, 16:9 is forced as a sensible default.\n\n\nstorage\nObject\n{ enabled: true, key: 'plyr' }\nenabled: Allow use of local storage to store user settings. key: The key name to use.\n\n\nspeed\nObject\n{ selected: 1, options: [0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2] }\nselected: The default speed for playback. options: The speed options to display in the UI. YouTube and Vimeo will ignore any options outside of the 0.5-2 range, so options outside of this range will be hidden automatically.\n\n\nquality\nObject\n{ default: 576, options: [4320, 2880, 2160, 1440, 1080, 720, 576, 480, 360, 240] }\ndefault is the default quality level (if it exists in your sources). options are the options to display. This is used to filter the available sources.\n\n\nloop\nObject\n{ active: false }\nactive: Whether to loop the current video. If the loop attribute is present on a <video> or <audio> element, this will be automatically set to true This is an object to support future functionality.\n\n\nads\nObject\n{ enabled: false, publisherId: '', tagUrl: '' }\nenabled: Whether to enable advertisements. publisherId: Your unique vi.ai publisher ID. tagUrl is a URL for a custom VAST tag if you're not using Vi.\n\n\nurls\nObject\nSee source.\nIf you wish to override any API URLs then you can do so here. You can also set a custom download URL for the download button.\n\n\nvimeo\nObject\n{ byline: false, portrait: false, title: false, speed: true, transparent: false }\nSee Vimeo embed options. Some are set automatically based on other config options, namely: loop, autoplay, muted, gesture, playsinline\n\n\nyoutube\nObject\n{ noCookie: false, rel: 0, showinfo: 0, iv_load_policy: 3, modestbranding: 1 }\nSee YouTube embed options. The only custom option is noCookie to use an alternative to YouTube that doesn't use cookies (useful for GDPR, etc). Some are set automatically based on other config options, namely: autoplay, hl, controls, disablekb, playsinline, cc_load_policy, cc_lang_pref, widget_referrer\n\n\npreviewThumbnails\nObject\n{ enabled: false, src: '' }\nenabled: Whether to enable the preview thumbnails (they must be generated by you). src must be either a string or an array of strings representing URLs for the VTT files containing the image URL(s). Learn more about preview thumbnails below.\n\n\n\n\nVimeo only\nAutoplay is generally not recommended as it is seen as a negative user experience. It is also disabled in many browsers.

The setter accepts a string containing a valid absolute URL.\n\n\n\n\nHTML5 only\n\nThe .source setter\nThis allows changing the player source and type on the fly.\nVideo example:\nplayer.source = {\n  type: 'video',\n  title: 'Example title',\n  sources: [\n    {\n      src: '\/path\/to\/movie.mp4',\n      type: 'video\/mp4',\n      size: 720,\n    },\n    {\n      src: '\/path\/to\/movie.webm',\n      type: 'video\/webm',\n      size: 1080,\n    },\n  ],\n  poster: '\/path\/to\/poster.jpg',\n  previewThumbnails: {\n    src: '\/path\/to\/thumbnails.vtt',\n  },\n  tracks: [\n    {\n      kind: 'captions',\n      label: 'English',\n      srclang: 'en',\n      src: '\/path\/to\/captions.en.vtt',\n      default: true,\n    },\n    {\n      kind: 'captions',\n      label: 'French',\n      srclang: 'fr',\n      src: '\/path\/to\/captions.fr.vtt',\n    },\n  ],\n};\nAudio example:\nplayer.source = {\n  type: 'audio',\n  title: 'Example title',\n  sources: [\n    {\n      src: '\/path\/to\/audio.mp3',\n      type: 'audio\/mp3',\n    },\n    {\n      src: '\/path\/to\/audio.ogg',\n      type: 'audio\/ogg',\n    },\n  ],\n};\nYouTube example:\nplayer.source = {\n  type: 'video',\n  sources: [\n    {\n      src: 'bTqVqk7FSmY',\n      provider: 'youtube',\n    },\n  ],\n};\nVimeo example\nplayer.source = {\n  type: 'video',\n  sources: [\n    {\n      src: '143418951',\n      provider: 'vimeo',\n    },\n  ],\n};\nNote: src property for YouTube and Vimeo can either be the video ID or the whole URL.\n\n\n\nProperty\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntype\nString\nEither video or audio. Note: YouTube and Vimeo are currently not supported as audio sources.\n\n\ntitle\nString\nOptional. Title of the new media. Used for the aria-label attribute on the play button, and outer container. YouTube and Vimeo are populated automatically.\n\n\nsources\nArray\nThis is an array of sources. For HTML5 media, the properties of this object are mapped directly to HTML attributes so more can be added to the object if required.\n\n\nposter\u00b9\nString\nThe URL for the poster image (HTML5 video only).\n\n\ntracks\u00b9\nString\nAn array of track objects. Each element in the array is mapped directly to a track element and any keys mapped directly to HTML attributes so as in the example above, it will render as <track kind=\"captions\" label=\"English\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.selz.com\/plyr\/1.0\/example_captions_en.vtt\" default> and similar for the French version. Booleans are converted to HTML5 value-less attributes.\n\n\npreviewThumbnails\u00b9\nObject\nThe same object like in the previewThumbnails constructor option. This means you can either change the thumbnails vtt via the src key or disable the thumbnails plugin for the next video by passing { enabled: false }.\n\n\n\n\nHTML5 only\n\nEvents\nYou can listen for events on the target element you setup Plyr on (see example under the table). Some events only apply to HTML5 audio and video. Using your\nreference to the instance, you can use the on() API method or addEventListener(). Access to the API can be obtained this way through the event.detail.plyr\nproperty. Here's an example:\nplayer.on('ready', event => {\n  const instance = event.detail.plyr;\n});\nStandard Media Events\n\n\n\nEvent Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nprogress\nSent periodically to inform interested parties of progress downloading the media. Information about the current amount of the media that has been downloaded is available in the media element's buffered attribute.\n\n\nplaying\nSent when the media begins to play (either for the first time, after having been paused, or after ending and then restarting).\n\n\nplay\nSent when playback of the media starts after having been paused; that is, when playback is resumed after a prior pause event.\n\n\npause\nSent when playback is paused.\n\n\ntimeupdate\nThe time indicated by the element's currentTime attribute has changed.\n\n\nvolumechange\nSent when the audio volume changes (both when the volume is set and when the muted state is changed).\n\n\nseeking\nSent when a seek operation begins.\n\n\nseeked\nSent when a seek operation completes.\n\n\nratechange\nSent when the playback speed changes.\n\n\nended\nSent when playback completes. Note: This does not fire if autoplay is true.\n\n\nenterfullscreen\nSent when the player enters fullscreen mode (either the proper fullscreen or full-window fallback for older browsers).\n\n\nexitfullscreen\nSent when the player exits fullscreen mode.\n\n\ncaptionsenabled\nSent when captions are enabled.\n\n\ncaptionsdisabled\nSent when captions are disabled.\n\n\nlanguagechange\nSent when the caption language is changed.\n\n\ncontrolshidden\nSent when the controls are hidden.\n\n\ncontrolsshown\nSent when the controls are shown.\n\n\nready\nTriggered when the instance is ready for API calls.\n\n\n\nHTML5 only\n\n\n\nEvent Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nloadstart\nSent when loading of the media begins.\n\n\nloadeddata\nThe first frame of the media has finished loading.\n\n\nloadedmetadata\nThe media's metadata has finished loading; all attributes now contain as much useful information as they're going to.\n\n\nqualitychange\nThe quality of playback has changed.\n\n\ncanplay\nSent when enough data is available that the media can be played, at least for a couple of frames. This corresponds to the HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA readyState.\n\n\ncanplaythrough\nSent when the ready state changes to CAN_PLAY_THROUGH, indicating that the entire media can be played without interruption, assuming the download rate remains at least at the current level. Note: Manually setting the currentTime will eventually fire a canplaythrough event in firefox. Other browsers might not fire this event.\n\n\nstalled\nSent when the user agent is trying to fetch media data, but data is unexpectedly not forthcoming.\n\n\nwaiting\nSent when the requested operation (such as playback) is delayed pending the completion of another operation (such as a seek).\n\n\nemptied\nhe media has become empty; for example, this event is sent if the media has already been loaded (or partially loaded), and the load() method is called to reload it.\n\n\ncuechange\nSent when a TextTrack has changed the currently displaying cues.\n\n\nerror\nSent when an error occurs. The element's error attribute contains more information.\n\n\n\nYouTube only\n\n\n\nEvent Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstatechange\nThe state of the player has changed. The code can be accessed via event.detail.code. Possible values are -1: Unstarted, 0: Ended, 1: Playing, 2: Paused, 3: Buffering, 5: Video cued. See the YouTube Docs for more information.\n\n\n\nNote: These events also bubble up the DOM. The event target will be the container element.\nSome event details borrowed from MDN.\nEmbeds\nYouTube and Vimeo are currently supported and function much like a HTML5 video. Similar events and API methods are available for all types. However if you wish\nto access the API's directly. You can do so via the embed property of your player object - e.g. player.embed. You can then use the relevant methods from the\nthird party APIs. More info on the respective API's here:\n\nYouTube iframe API Reference\nVimeo player.js Reference\n\nNote: Not all API methods may work 100%. Your mileage may vary. It's better to use the Plyr API where possible.\nShortcuts\nBy default, a player will bind the following keyboard shortcuts when it has focus. If you have the global option to true and there's only one player in the\ndocument then the shortcuts will work when any element has focus, apart from an element that requires input.\n\n\n\nKey\nAction\n\n\n\n\n0 to 9\nSeek from 0 to 90% respectively\n\n\nspace\nToggle playback\n\n\nK\nToggle playback\n\n\n\u2190\nSeek backward by the seekTime option\n\n\n\u2192\nSeek forward by the seekTime option\n\n\n\u2191\nIncrease volume\n\n\n\u2193\nDecrease volume\n\n\nM\nToggle mute\n\n\nF\nToggle fullscreen\n\n\nC\nToggle captions\n\n\nL\nToggle loop\n\n\n\nPreview thumbnails\nIt's possible to display preview thumbnails as per the demo when you hover over the scrubber or while you are scrubbing in the main video area. This can be used for all video types but is easiest with HTML5 of course. You will need to generate the sprite or images yourself. This is possible using something like AWS transcoder to generate the frames and then combine them into a sprite image. Sprites are recommended for performance reasons - they will be much faster to download and easier to compress into a small file size making them load faster.\nYou can see the example VTT files here and here for how the sprites are done. The coordinates are set as the xywh hash on the URL in the order X Offset, Y Offset, Width, Height (e.g. 240p-00001.jpg#xywh=1708,480,427,240 is offset 1708px from the left, 480px from the top and is 427x240px. If you want to include images per frame, this is also possible but will be slower, resulting in a degraded experience.\nFullscreen\nFullscreen in Plyr is supported by all browsers that currently support it.\nBrowser support\nPlyr supports the last 2 versions of most modern browsers.\n\n\n\nBrowser\nSupported\n\n\n\n\nSafari\n\u2713\n\n\nMobile Safari\n\u2713\u00b9\n\n\nFirefox\n\u2713\n\n\nChrome\n\u2713\n\n\nOpera\n\u2713\n\n\nEdge\n\u2713\n\n\nIE11\n\u2713\u00b3\n\n\nIE10\n\u27132,3\n\n\n\n\nMobile Safari on the iPhone forces the native player for <video> unless the playsinline attribute is present. Volume controls are also disabled as they are handled device wide.\nNative player used (no support for <progress> or <input type=\"range\">) but the API is supported. No native fullscreen support, fallback can be used (see options).\nPolyfills required. See below.\n\nPolyfills\nPlyr uses ES6 which isn't supported in all browsers quite yet. This means some features will need to be polyfilled to be available otherwise you'll run into issues. We've elected to not burden the ~90% of users that do support these features with extra JS and instead leave polyfilling to you to work out based on your needs. The easiest method I've found is to use polyfill.io which provides polyfills based on user agent. This is the method the demo uses.\nChecking for support\nYou can use the static method to check for support. For example\nconst supported = Plyr.supported('video', 'html5', true);\nThe arguments are:\n\nMedia type (audio or video)\nProvider (html5, youtube or vimeo)\nWhether the player has the playsinline attribute (only applicable to iOS 10+)\n\nDisable support programmatically\nThe enabled option can be used to disable certain User Agents. For example, if you don't want to use Plyr for smartphones, you could use:\n{\n  enabled: !\/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry\/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\n}\nIf a User Agent is disabled but supports <video> and <audio> natively, it will use the native player.\nPlugins & Components\nSome awesome folks have made plugins for CMSs and Components for JavaScript frameworks:\n\n\n\nType\nMaintainer\nLink\n\n\n\n\nWordPress\nBrandon Lavigne (@drrobotnik)\nhttps:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/plyr\/\n\n\nAngular\nSimon Bobrov (@smnbbrv)\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/smnbbrv\/ngx-plyr\n\n\nReact\nChintan Prajapati (@chintan9)\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/chintan9\/plyr-react\n\n\nVue\nGabe Dunn (@redxtech)\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/redxtech\/vue-plyr\n\n\nNeos\nJon Uhlmann (@jonnitto)\nhttps:\/\/packagist.org\/packages\/jonnitto\/plyr\n\n\nKirby\nDominik Pschenitschni (@dpschen)\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/dpschen\/kirby-plyrtag\n\n\nREDAXO\nFriendsOfRedaxo \/ skerbis (@skerbis)\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/FriendsOfREDAXO\/plyr\n\n\nsvelte-plyr\nBen Woodward \/ benwoodward (@benwoodward)\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/benwoodward\n\n\n\nIssues\nIf you find anything weird with Plyr, please let us know using the GitHub issues tracker.\nAuthor\nPlyr is developed by @sam_potts \/ sampotts.me with help from the awesome\ncontributors\nDonate\nPlyr costs money to run, not only my time.

The only limitation is that the numbers and colors contained within must be in the same order:\nanimate({\n  from: \"0px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\",\n  to: \"10px 10px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)\"\n})\nThe type of animation performed will be automatically detected from the provided options, or can be chosen manually by defining type as \"keyframes\", \"spring\" or \"decay\".\nOptions\nThese options can be set for all animations:\nfrom\nAn initial value to start the animation from.\nDefaults to 0\nanimate({\n  from: \"linear-gradient(#e66465, #9198e5)\",\n  to: \"linear-gradient(#9198e5, #e66465)\"\n})\nelapsed\nSets an initial elapsed time, in milliseconds. Set to a negative value for a delay.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  elapsed: -300\n})\nrepeat\nThe number of times to repeat the animation. Set to Infinity to repeat forever.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  repeat: 2\n})\nrepeatDelay\nThe duration, in milliseconds, to wait before repeating the animation.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  repeat: 2,\n  repeatDelay: 200\n})\nrepeatType\nEither \"loop\", \"mirror\" or \"reverse\". Defaults to \"loop\".\n\n\"loop\": Repeats the animation from 0.\n\"mirror\": Swaps the from\/to values alternately.\n\"reverse\": Reverses the animation alternately.\n\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  repeat: 2,\n  repeatType: \"reverse\"\n})\ndriver\nBy default, the animation will be driven by a requestAnimationFrame loop. driver can specify a different source.\nA Driver is a function that accepts the animations update function. This is a function that can be called with a time delta from the previous frame. The Driver must return a function that will be called when the animation is stopped.\nconst xrDriver = session => update => {\n  let latestRequestId = 0\n  let prevTimestamp = performance.now()\n  \n  const step = timestamp => {\n    const delta = timestamp - prevTimestamp\n    prevTimestamp = timestamp\n\n    update(delta)\n\n    latestRequestId = session.requestAnimationFrame(step)\n  }\n\n  let latestRequestId = session.requestAnimationFrame(step)\n\n  return () => session.cancelRequestAnimationFrame(latestRequestId)\n}\n\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  driver: xrDriver(xrSession)\n})\ntype\nanimate will automatically detect the type of animation to use based on the options provided. But a specific type can be chosen manually by defining type as \"keyframes\", \"spring\" or \"decay\".\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  type: \"spring\"\n})\nLifecycle events\nThe following lifecycle events are available for all animations:\nonUpdate\nThis is called every frame the animation fires with the latest computed value.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  onUpdate: latest => console.log(latest)\n})\nonPlay\nThis is called when the animation starts. Currently this automatically when animate is called.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  onPlay: () => {}\n})\nonComplete\nThis is called when the animation successfully completes.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  onComplete:() => {}\n})\nonRepeat\nThis is called when an animation repeats.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  repeat: 2,\n  onRepeat: () => {}\n})\nonStop\nThis is called when the animation is stopped by the stop control.\nconst animation = animate({\n  to: 100,\n  onStop: () => {}\n})\n\nanimation.stop()\nKeyframes options\nA keyframes animation is the default animation type and it can be defined either with a from and to option:\nanimate({ from: 0, to: 100 })\nOr as a series of keyframes provided to the to option:\nanimate({ to: [0, 100, 200] })\nto\nA single value to animate to, or an array of values to animate through.\nanimate({\n  to: [\"#0ff\", \"#f00\", \"#0f0\"]\n})\nIf to is an array, any defined from will be ignored.\nduration\nThis defines the duration of the animation, in milliseconds.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  duration: 300\n})\nease\nThis is an easing function, or array of functions, to use when easing between each keyframe.\nimport { animate, linear, easeInOut } from \"popmotion\"\n\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  ease: linear\n})\n\nanimate({\n  to: [\"#fff\", \"#000\", \"#f00\"],\n  ease: [linear, easeInOut]\n})\nIf set as any array, the length of this array must be one shorter than the number of values being animated between.\noffset\nThis is an array of values between 0 and 1 that defines at which point throughout the animation each keyframe should be reached.\nThis array should be the same length as the number of defined keyframes.\nanimate({\n  to: [\"#fff\", \"#000\", \"#f00\"],\n  offset: [0, 0.2, 1]\n})\nSpring options\nSprings are great for creating natural-feeling interfaces and dynamic interruptable animations.\nA spring animation will be used if any of the stiffness, damping or mass options are detected.\nNote: A spring simulation is inherently numerical so if it's given a color, array or object, it runs the animation from 0 to 100 and interpolates that to the given values. This strategy is likely to be tweaked before the official release so animations made this way may change in feel.\nto\nA single value to animate to.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  type: \"spring\"\n})\nIf to is an array, any defined from will be ignored.\nstiffness\nThis defines the stiffness of the spring. A higher stiffness will result in a snappier animation.\nDefaults to 100\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  stiffness: 1000\n})\ndamping\nThis is the opposing force to stiffness. As you reduce this value, relative to stiffness, the spring will become bouncier and the animation will last longer. Likewise, higher relative values will have less bounciness and result in shorter animations.\nDefaults to 10\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  damping: 50\n})\nmass\nThis is the mass of the animating object. Heavier objects will take longer to speed up and slow down.\nDefaults to 1.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  mass: 2\n})\nvelocity\nThe initial velocity, in units per second, of the animation.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  velocity: 1000\n})\nduration\nThe duration of the spring, in milliseconds.\nWill be overridden by stiffness, mass or damping.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  duration: 1000\n})\nbounce\nThe bounciness of the spring, as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is no bounce.\nWill be overridden by stiffness, mass or damping.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  bounce: 0.2\n})\nrestDelta\nThe distance from the animation target at which the animation can be considered complete. When both restDelta and restSpeed are met, the animation completes.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  restDelta: 0.5\n})\nrestSpeed\nThe absolute velocity, in units per second, below which the animation can be considered complete. When both restDelta and restSpeed are met, the animation completes. Defaults to 10.\nanimate({\n  to: 100,\n  restSpeed: 5\n})\nPlayback controls\nanimate returns PlaybackControls, which can be used to control the playback of the animation.\nCurrently this only includes a stop method, but may expand with more.\nstop\nStops the animation.\nconst playback = animate({ from: 0, to: 100 })\nplayback.stop()\ninertia\nThe inertia animation is used to gradually decelerate a number. Think smartphone scroll momentum.\nOptions\nIn addition to animate's from, onUpdate and onComplete options, inertia also supports the following:\nvelocity\nThe initial velocity, in units per second, of the animation.\ninertia({\n  from: 0,\n  velocity: 100\n})\npower\nA constant with which to calculate a target value. Higher power = further target.\nDefaults to 0.8.\ninertia({\n  from: 0,\n  power: 0.3\n})\ntimeConstant\nAdjusting the time constant will change the duration of the deceleration, thereby affecting its feel.\nDefaults to 350.\ninertia({\n  from: 0,\n  velocity: 100,\n  timeConstant: 400\n})\nmodifyTarget\nA function that receives the calculated target and returns a new one. Useful for snapping the target to a grid.\nconst roundToNearest = target => v => Math.ceil(v \/ target) * target\n\ninertia({\n  from: 0,\n  velocity: 100,\n  modifyTarget: roundToNearest(100)\n})\nmin\nThe minimum value at which the animation will switch from gradual deceleration and use a spring animation to snap to this point.\ninertia({\n  from: 50,\n  velocity: -100,\n  min: 0\n})\nmax\nThe maximum value at which the animation will switch from gradual deceleration and use a spring animation to snap to this point.\ninertia({\n  from: 50,\n  velocity: 100,\n  max: 100\n})\nbounceStiffness\nThis defines the stiffness of the spring when the animation hits either min or max. A higher stiffness will result in a snappier animation.\nDefaults to 500\ninertia({\n  from: 0,\n  velocity: 100,\n  max: 50,\n  bounceStiffness: 1000\n})\nbounceDamping\nThis is the opposing force to bounceStiffness. As you reduce this value, relative to bounceStiffness, the spring will become bouncier and the animation will last longer. Likewise, higher relative values will have less bounciness and result in shorter animations.\nDefaults to 10\ninertia({\n  from: 0,\n  velocity: 100,\n  max: 50,\n  bounceDamping: 300\n})\nrestDelta\nThe distance from the animation target at which the animation can be considered complete.\ninertia({\n  from: 0,\n  velocity: 100,\n  restDelta: 0.5\n})\nIterators\nPowering animate and inertia are the keyframes, spring, and decay iterators.\nimport { keyframes, spring, decay } from \"popmotion\";\nIterators give you the ability to run an animation with a high degree of control. For example, Framer uses the spring iterator to draw its animation editor visualiser by running it synchronously.\nEach can be initialised with the matching options above (decay with a subset of inertia's options, excluding the bounce- options):\nconst animation = spring({\n  from: 0,\n  to: 100,\n  stiffness: 200\n})\nWith the returned iterator, you can resolve the animation at a specific timestamp with its next method.\n\/\/ Resolve the animation at 200ms\nconst { value, done } = animation.next(200)\nEasing\nPopmotion includes a number of in-built easing functions, as well as factory functions to make entirely new ones.\nFunctions\nEach easing function can be imported like so:\nimport { linear } from \"popmotion\"\nEach function accepts a progress value between 0 and 1, and returns a new one:\nconst progress = 0.5\nconst easedProgress = easeInOut(progress)\n\nlinear\neaseIn\neaseInOut\neaseOut\ncircIn\ncircInOut\ncircOut\nbackIn\nbackInOut\nbackOut\nanticipate\nbounceIn\nbounceInOut\nbounceOut\n\nFactories\ncubicBezier\nimport { cubicBezier } from \"popmotion\"\n\nconst easing = cubicBezier(0, .42, 0, 1)\nNew cubic bezier definitions can be created in the Framer animation editor and copy\/pasted directly into this function.\nsteps\nsteps returns an easing function that will convert the animation into a discrete series of steps.\nimport { steps } from \"popmotion\"\n\nconst easing = steps(5)\nIt optionally accepts a second parameter, either \"start\" or \"end\" (default)that decides whether the steps are aligned with the start or end of the animation.\nsteps(5, \"start\")\nmirrorEasing\nMirrors an existing easing function.\nreverseEasing\nReverses an existing easing function.

It defaults to Web Audio API and falls back to HTML5 Audio. This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.\nAdditional information, live demos and a user showcase are available at howlerjs.com.\nFollow on Twitter for howler.js and development-related discussion: @GoldFireStudios.\nFeatures\n\nSingle API for all audio needs\nDefaults to Web Audio API and falls back to HTML5 Audio\nHandles edge cases and bugs across environments\nSupports all codecs for full cross-browser support\nAutomatic caching for improved performance\nControl sounds individually, in groups or globally\nPlayback of multiple sounds at once\nEasy sound sprite definition and playback\nFull control for fading, rate, seek, volume, etc.\nEasily add 3D spatial sound or stereo panning\nModular - use what you want and easy to extend\nNo outside dependencies, just pure JavaScript\nAs light as 7kb gzipped\n\nBrowser Compatibility\nTested in the following browsers\/versions:\n\nGoogle Chrome 7.0+\nInternet Explorer 9.0+\nFirefox 4.0+\nSafari 5.1.4+\nMobile Safari 6.0+ (after user input)\nOpera 12.0+\nMicrosoft Edge\n\nLive Demos\n\nAudio Player\nRadio\nSpatial Audio\nAudio Sprites\n\nDocumentation\nContents\n\nQuick Start\nExamples\nCore\n\nOptions\nMethods\nGlobal Options\nGlobal Methods\n\n\nPlugin: Spatial\n\nOptions\nMethods\nGlobal Methods\n\n\nMobile Playback\nDolby Audio Playback\nFacebook Instant Games\nFormat Recommendations\nLicense\n\nQuick Start\nSeveral options to get up and running:\n\nClone the repo: git clone https:\/\/github.com\/goldfire\/howler.js.git\nInstall with npm: npm install howler\nInstall with Yarn: yarn add howler\nInstall with Bower: bower install howler\nHosted CDN: cdnjs jsDelivr\n\nIn the browser:\n<script src=\"\/path\/to\/howler.js\"><\/script>\n<script>\n    var sound = new Howl({\n      src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']\n    });\n<\/script>\nAs a dependency:\nimport {Howl, Howler} from 'howler';\nconst {Howl, Howler} = require('howler');\nExamples\nMost basic, play an MP3:\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.mp3']\n});\n\nsound.play();\nMore playback options:\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3', 'sound.wav'],\n  autoplay: true,\n  loop: true,\n  volume: 0.5,\n  onend: function() {\n    console.log('Finished!');\n  }\n});\nDefine and play a sound sprite:\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sounds.webm', 'sounds.mp3'],\n  sprite: {\n    blast: [0, 3000],\n    laser: [4000, 1000],\n    winner: [6000, 5000]\n  }\n});\n\n\/\/ Shoot the laser!\nsound.play('laser');\nListen for events:\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']\n});\n\n\/\/ Clear listener after first call.\nsound.once('load', function(){\n  sound.play();\n});\n\n\/\/ Fires when the sound finishes playing.\nsound.on('end', function(){\n  console.log('Finished!');\n});\nControl multiple sounds:\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']\n});\n\n\/\/ Play returns a unique Sound ID that can be passed\n\/\/ into any method on Howl to control that specific sound.\nvar id1 = sound.play();\nvar id2 = sound.play();\n\n\/\/ Fade out the first sound and speed up the second.\nsound.fade(1, 0, 1000, id1);\nsound.rate(1.5, id2);\nES6:\nimport {Howl, Howler} from 'howler';\n\n\/\/ Setup the new Howl.\nconst sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']\n});\n\n\/\/ Play the sound.\nsound.play();\n\n\/\/ Change global volume.\nHowler.volume(0.5);\nMore in-depth examples (with accompanying live demos) can be found in the examples directory.\nCore\nOptions\nsrc Array\/String [] required\nThe sources to the track(s) to be loaded for the sound (URLs or base64 data URIs). These should be in order of preference, howler.js will automatically load the first one that is compatible with the current browser. If your files have no extensions, you will need to explicitly specify the extension using the format property.\nvolume Number 1.0\nThe volume of the specific track, from 0.0 to 1.0.\nhtml5 Boolean false\nSet to true to force HTML5 Audio. This should be used for large audio files so that you don't have to wait for the full file to be downloaded and decoded before playing.\nloop Boolean false\nSet to true to automatically loop the sound forever.\npreload Boolean|String true\nAutomatically begin downloading the audio file when the Howl is defined. If using HTML5 Audio, you can set this to 'metadata' to only preload the file's metadata (to get its duration without download the entire file, for example).\nautoplay Boolean false\nSet to true to automatically start playback when sound is loaded.\nmute Boolean false\nSet to true to load the audio muted.\nsprite Object {}\nDefine a sound sprite for the sound. The offset and duration are defined in milliseconds. A third (optional) parameter is available to set a sprite as looping. An easy way to generate compatible sound sprites is with audiosprite.\nnew Howl({\n  sprite: {\n    key1: [offset, duration, (loop)]\n  },\n});\nrate Number 1.0\nThe rate of playback. 0.5 to 4.0, with 1.0 being normal speed.\npool Number 5\nThe size of the inactive sounds pool. Once sounds are stopped or finish playing, they are marked as ended and ready for cleanup. We keep a pool of these to recycle for improved performance. Generally this doesn't need to be changed. It is important to keep in mind that when a sound is paused, it won't be removed from the pool and will still be considered active so that it can be resumed later.\nformat Array []\nhowler.js automatically detects your file format from the extension, but you may also specify a format in situations where extraction won't work (such as with a SoundCloud stream).\nxhr Object null\nWhen using Web Audio, howler.js uses an XHR request to load the audio files. If you need to send custom headers, set the HTTP method or enable withCredentials (see reference), include them with this parameter. Each is optional (method defaults to GET, headers default to null and withCredentials defaults to false). For example:\n\/\/ Using each of the properties.\nnew Howl({\n  xhr: {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: 'Bearer:' + token,\n    },\n    withCredentials: true,\n  }\n});\n\n\/\/ Only changing the method.\nnew Howl({\n  xhr: {\n    method: 'POST',\n  }\n});\nonload Function\nFires when the sound is loaded.\nonloaderror Function\nFires when the sound is unable to load. The first parameter is the ID of the sound (if it exists) and the second is the error message\/code.\nonplayerror Function\nFires when the sound is unable to play. The first parameter is the ID of the sound and the second is the error message\/code.\nonplay Function\nFires when the sound begins playing. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonend Function\nFires when the sound finishes playing (if it is looping, it'll fire at the end of each loop). The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonpause Function\nFires when the sound has been paused. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonstop Function\nFires when the sound has been stopped. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonmute Function\nFires when the sound has been muted\/unmuted. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonvolume Function\nFires when the sound's volume has changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonrate Function\nFires when the sound's playback rate has changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonseek Function\nFires when the sound has been seeked. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonfade Function\nFires when the current sound finishes fading in\/out. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\nonunlock Function\nFires when audio has been automatically unlocked through a touch\/click event.\nMethods\nplay([sprite\/id])\nBegins playback of a sound.

Thus, these values are expected to be at right angles from each other.\n\nx: Number The x-orientation of listener.\ny: Number The y-orientation of listener.\nz: Number The z-orientation of listener.\nxUp: Number The x-orientation of the top of the listener.\nyUp: Number The y-orientation of the top of the listener.\nzUp: Number The z-orientation of the top of the listener.\n\nMobile\/Chrome Playback\nBy default, audio on mobile browsers and Chrome\/Safari is locked until a sound is played within a user interaction, and then it plays normally the rest of the page session (Apple documentation). The default behavior of howler.js is to attempt to silently unlock audio playback by playing an empty buffer on the first touchend event. This behavior can be disabled by calling:\nHowler.autoUnlock = false;\nIf you try to play audio automatically on page load, you can listen to a playerror event and then wait for the unlock event to try and play the audio again:\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3'],\n  onplayerror: function() {\n    sound.once('unlock', function() {\n      sound.play();\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nsound.play();\nDolby Audio Playback\nFull support for playback of the Dolby Audio format (currently support in Edge and Safari) is included. However, you must specify that the file you are loading is dolby since it is in a mp4 container.\nvar dolbySound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.mp4', 'sound.webm', 'sound.mp3'],\n  format: ['dolby', 'webm', 'mp3']\n});\nFacebook Instant Games\nHowler.js provides audio support for the new Facebook Instant Games platform. If you encounter any issues while developing for Instant Games, open an issue with the tag [IG].\nFormat Recommendations\nHowler.js supports a wide array of audio codecs that have varying browser support (\"mp3\", \"opus\", \"ogg\", \"wav\", \"aac\", \"m4a\", \"m4b\", \"mp4\", \"webm\", ...), but if you want full browser coverage you still need to use at least two of them. If your goal is to have the best balance of small filesize and high quality, based on extensive production testing, your best bet is to default to webm and fallback to mp3. webm has nearly full browser coverage with a great combination of compression and quality. You'll need the mp3 fallback for Internet Explorer.\nIt is important to remember that howler.js selects the first compatible sound from your array of sources. So if you want webm to be used before mp3, you need to put the sources in that order.\nIf you want your webm files to be seekable in Firefox, be sure to encode them with the cues element. One way to do this is by using the dash flag in ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i sound1.wav -dash 1 sound1.webm\n\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2013-2020 James Simpson and GoldFire Studios, Inc.\nReleased under the MIT License.\n","107":"Highlight.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works in\nthe browser as well as on the server. It works with pretty much any\nmarkup, doesn\u2019t depend on any framework, and has automatic language\ndetection.\nUpgrading to Version 10\nVersion 10 is one of the biggest releases in quite some time.  If you're\nupgrading from version 9, there are some breaking changes and things you may\nwant to double check first.\nPlease read VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md for  high-level summary of breaking changes and any actions you may need to take. See VERSION_10_BREAKING_CHANGES.md for a more detailed list and CHANGES.md to learn what else is new.\nSupport for older versions\nPlease see SECURITY.md for support information.\nGetting Started\nThe bare minimum for using highlight.js on a web page is linking to the\nlibrary along with one of the styles and calling initHighlightingOnLoad:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"\/path\/to\/styles\/default.css\">\n<script src=\"\/path\/to\/highlight.min.js\"><\/script>\n<script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();<\/script>\nThis will find and highlight code inside of <pre><code> tags; it tries\nto detect the language automatically. If automatic detection doesn\u2019t\nwork for you, you can specify the language in the class attribute:\n<pre><code class=\"html\">...<\/code><\/pre>\nClasses may also be prefixed with either language- or lang-.\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">...<\/code><\/pre>\nPlaintext and Disabling Highlighting\nTo style arbitrary text like code, but without any highlighting, use the\nplaintext class:\n<pre><code class=\"plaintext\">...<\/code><\/pre>\nTo disable highlighting of a tag completely, use the nohighlight class:\n<pre><code class=\"nohighlight\">...<\/code><\/pre>\nSupported Languages\nHighlight.js supports over 180 different languages in the core library.  There are also 3rd party\nlanguage plugins available for additional languages. You can find the full list of supported languages\nin SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.md.\nCustom Initialization\nWhen you need a bit more control over the initialization of\nhighlight.js, you can use the highlightBlock and configure\nfunctions. This allows you to control what to highlight and when.\nHere\u2019s an equivalent way to calling initHighlightingOnLoad using\nvanilla JS:\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n  document.querySelectorAll('pre code').forEach((block) => {\n    hljs.highlightBlock(block);\n  });\n});\nYou can use any tags instead of <pre><code> to mark up your code. If\nyou don't use a container that preserves line breaks you will need to\nconfigure highlight.js to use the <br> tag:\nhljs.configure({useBR: true});\n\ndocument.querySelectorAll('div.code').forEach((block) => {\n  hljs.highlightBlock(block);\n});\nFor other options refer to the documentation for configure.\nUsing with Vue.js\nSimply register the plugin with Vue:\nVue.use(hljs.vuePlugin);\nAnd you'll be provided with a highlightjs component for use\nin your templates:\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <!-- bind to a data property named `code` -->\n    <highlightjs autodetect :code=\"code\" \/>\n    <!-- or literal code works as well -->\n    <highlightjs language='javascript' code=\"var x = 5;\" \/>\n  <\/div>\nWeb Workers\nYou can run highlighting inside a web worker to avoid freezing the browser\nwindow while dealing with very big chunks of code.\nIn your main script:\naddEventListener('load', () => {\n  const code = document.querySelector('#code');\n  const worker = new Worker('worker.js');\n  worker.onmessage = (event) => { code.innerHTML = event.data; }\n  worker.postMessage(code.textContent);\n});\nIn worker.js:\nonmessage = (event) => {\n  importScripts('<path>\/highlight.min.js');\n  const result = self.hljs.highlightAuto(event.data);\n  postMessage(result.value);\n};\nNode.js\nYou can use highlight.js with node to highlight content before sending it to the browser.\nMake sure to use the .value property to get the formatted html.\nFor more info about the returned object refer to the api docs https:\/\/highlightjs.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/api.html\n\/\/ require the highlight.js library, including all languages\nconst hljs = require('.\/highlight.js');\nconst highlightedCode = hljs.highlightAuto('<span>Hello World!<\/span>').value\nOr for a smaller footprint... load just the languages you need.\nconst hljs = require(\"highlight.js\/lib\/core\");  \/\/ require only the core library\n\/\/ separately require languages\nhljs.registerLanguage('xml', require('highlight.js\/lib\/languages\/xml'));\n\nconst highlightedCode = hljs.highlight('xml', '<span>Hello World!<\/span>').value\nES6 Modules\nFirst, you'll likely install via npm or yarn -- see Getting the Library below.\nIn your application:\nimport hljs from 'highlight.js';\nThe default import imports all languages. Therefore it is likely to be more efficient to import only the library and the languages you need:\nimport hljs from 'highlight.js\/lib\/core';\nimport javascript from 'highlight.js\/lib\/languages\/javascript';\nhljs.registerLanguage('javascript', javascript);\nTo set the syntax highlighting style, if your build tool processes CSS from your JavaScript entry point, you can also import the stylesheet directly as modules:\nimport hljs from 'highlight.js\/lib\/core';\nimport 'highlight.js\/styles\/github.css';\nGetting the Library\nYou can get highlight.js as a hosted, or custom-build, browser script or\nas a server module. Right out of the box the browser script supports\nboth AMD and CommonJS, so if you wish you can use RequireJS or\nBrowserify without having to build from source. The server module also\nworks perfectly fine with Browserify, but there is the option to use a\nbuild specific to browsers rather than something meant for a server.\nDo not link to GitHub directly.

A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.\nSelectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.\n\nYou can play around with the following example in this codepen:\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst shopItemsSelector = state => state.shop.items\nconst taxPercentSelector = state => state.shop.taxPercent\n\nconst subtotalSelector = createSelector(\n  shopItemsSelector,\n  items => items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0)\n)\n\nconst taxSelector = createSelector(\n  subtotalSelector,\n  taxPercentSelector,\n  (subtotal, taxPercent) => subtotal * (taxPercent \/ 100)\n)\n\nexport const totalSelector = createSelector(\n  subtotalSelector,\n  taxSelector,\n  (subtotal, tax) => ({ total: subtotal + tax })\n)\n\nlet exampleState = {\n  shop: {\n    taxPercent: 8,\n    items: [\n      { name: 'apple', value: 1.20 },\n      { name: 'orange', value: 0.95 },\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log(subtotalSelector(exampleState)) \/\/ 2.15\nconsole.log(taxSelector(exampleState))      \/\/ 0.172\nconsole.log(totalSelector(exampleState))    \/\/ { total: 2.322 }\nTable of Contents\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nExample\n\nMotivation for Memoized Selectors\nCreating a Memoized Selector\nComposing Selectors\nConnecting a Selector to the Redux Store\nAccessing React Props in Selectors\nSharing Selectors with Props Across Multiple Component Instances\n\n\n\nAPI\n\ncreateSelector\ndefaultMemoize\ncreateSelectorCreator\ncreateStructuredSelector\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy isn't my selector recomputing when the input state changes?\nWhy is my selector recomputing when the input state stays the same?\nCan I use Reselect without Redux?\nThe default memoization function is no good, can I use a different one?\nHow do I test a selector?\nHow do I create a selector that takes an argument? \nHow do I use Reselect with Immutable.js?\nCan I share a selector across multiple component instances?\nAre there TypeScript typings?\nHow can I make a curried selector?\n\n\n\nRelated Projects\n\n\nLicense\n\n\nInstallation\nnpm install reselect\n\nExample\nIf you prefer a video tutorial, you can find one here.\nMotivation for Memoized Selectors\n\nThe examples in this section are based on the Redux Todos List example.\n\ncontainers\/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '..\/actions'\nimport TodoList from '..\/components\/TodoList'\n\nconst getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'SHOW_ALL':\n      return todos\n    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n      return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nIn the above example, mapStateToProps calls getVisibleTodos to calculate todos. This works great, but there is a drawback: todos is calculated every time the state tree is updated. If the state tree is large, or the calculation expensive, repeating the calculation on every update may cause performance problems. Reselect can help to avoid these unnecessary recalculations.\nCreating a Memoized Selector\nWe would like to replace getVisibleTodos with a memoized selector that recalculates todos when the value of state.todos or state.visibilityFilter changes, but not when changes occur in other (unrelated) parts of the state tree.\nReselect provides a function createSelector for creating memoized selectors. createSelector takes an array of input-selectors and a transform function as its arguments. If the Redux state tree is mutated in a way that causes the value of an input-selector to change, the selector will call its transform function with the values of the input-selectors as arguments and return the result. If the values of the input-selectors are the same as the previous call to the selector, it will return the previously computed value instead of calling the transform function.\nLet's define a memoized selector named getVisibleTodos to replace the non-memoized version above:\nselectors\/index.js\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state) => state.visibilityFilter\nconst getTodos = (state) => state.todos\n\nexport const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(\n  [ getVisibilityFilter, getTodos ],\n  (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n    switch (visibilityFilter) {\n      case 'SHOW_ALL':\n        return todos\n      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n        return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n        return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n    }\n  }\n)\nIn the example above, getVisibilityFilter and getTodos are input-selectors. They are created as ordinary non-memoized selector functions because they do not transform the data they select. getVisibleTodos on the other hand is a memoized selector. It takes getVisibilityFilter and getTodos as input-selectors, and a transform function that calculates the filtered todos list.\nComposing Selectors\nA memoized selector can itself be an input-selector to another memoized selector. Here is getVisibleTodos being used as an input-selector to a selector that further filters the todos by keyword:\nconst getKeyword = (state) => state.keyword\n\nconst getVisibleTodosFilteredByKeyword = createSelector(\n  [ getVisibleTodos, getKeyword ],\n  (visibleTodos, keyword) => visibleTodos.filter(\n    todo => todo.text.includes(keyword)\n  )\n)\nConnecting a Selector to the Redux Store\nIf you are using React Redux, you can call selectors as regular functions inside mapStateToProps():\ncontainers\/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '..\/actions'\nimport TodoList from '..\/components\/TodoList'\nimport { getVisibleTodos } from '..\/selectors'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nAccessing React Props in Selectors\n\nThis section introduces a hypothetical extension to our app that allows it to support multiple Todo Lists. Please note that a full implementation of this extension requires changes to the reducers, components, actions etc. that aren\u2019t directly relevant to the topics discussed and have been omitted for brevity.\n\nSo far we have only seen selectors receive the Redux store state as an argument, but a selector can receive props too.\nHere is an App component that renders three VisibleTodoList component instances, each of which has a listId prop:\ncomponents\/App.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Footer from '.\/Footer'\nimport AddTodo from '..\/containers\/AddTodo'\nimport VisibleTodoList from '..\/containers\/VisibleTodoList'\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <div>\n    <VisibleTodoList listId=\"1\" \/>\n    <VisibleTodoList listId=\"2\" \/>\n    <VisibleTodoList listId=\"3\" \/>\n  <\/div>\n)\nEach VisibleTodoList container should select a different slice of the state depending on the value of the listId prop, so let\u2019s modify getVisibilityFilter and getTodos to accept a props argument:\nselectors\/todoSelectors.js\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].visibilityFilter\n\nconst getTodos = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].todos\n\nconst getVisibleTodos = createSelector(\n  [ getVisibilityFilter, getTodos ],\n  (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n    switch (visibilityFilter) {\n      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n        return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)\n      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n        return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed)\n      default:\n        return todos\n    }\n  }\n)\n\nexport default getVisibleTodos\nprops can be passed to getVisibleTodos from mapStateToProps:\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n  }\n}\nSo now getVisibleTodos has access to props, and everything seems to be working fine.\nBut there is a problem!\nUsing the getVisibleTodos selector with multiple instances of the VisibleTodoList container will not correctly memoize:\ncontainers\/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '..\/actions'\nimport TodoList from '..\/components\/TodoList'\nimport { getVisibleTodos } from '..\/selectors'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n  return {\n    \/\/ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING SELECTOR DOES NOT CORRECTLY MEMOIZE\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nA selector created with createSelector has a cache size of 1 and only returns the cached value when its set of arguments is the same as its previous set of arguments. If we alternate between rendering <VisibleTodoList listId=\"1\" \/> and <VisibleTodoList listId=\"2\" \/>, the shared selector will alternate between receiving {listId: 1} and {listId: 2} as its props argument. This will cause the arguments to be different on each call, so the selector will always recompute instead of returning the cached value. We\u2019ll see how to overcome this limitation in the next section.\nSharing Selectors with Props Across Multiple Component Instances\n\nThe examples in this section require React Redux v4.3.0 or greater\n\n\nAn alternative approach can be found in re-reselect\n\nTo share a selector across multiple VisibleTodoList instances while passing in props and retaining memoization, each instance of the component needs its own private copy of the selector.\nLet\u2019s create a function named makeGetVisibleTodos that returns a new copy of the getVisibleTodos selector each time it is called:\nselectors\/todoSelectors.js\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].visibilityFilter\n\nconst getTodos = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].todos\n\nconst makeGetVisibleTodos = () => {\n  return createSelector(\n    [ getVisibilityFilter, getTodos ],\n    (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n      switch (visibilityFilter) {\n        case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n          return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)\n        case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n          return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed)\n        default:\n          return todos\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nexport default makeGetVisibleTodos\nWe also need a way to give each instance of a container access to its own private selector. The mapStateToProps argument of connect can help with this.\nIf the mapStateToProps argument supplied to connect returns a function instead of an object, it will be used to create an individual mapStateToProps function for each instance of the container.\nIn the example below makeMapStateToProps creates a new getVisibleTodos selector, and returns a mapStateToProps function that has exclusive access to the new selector:\nconst makeMapStateToProps = () => {\n  const getVisibleTodos = makeGetVisibleTodos()\n  const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n    return {\n      todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n    }\n  }\n  return mapStateToProps\n}\nIf we pass makeMapStateToProps to connect, each instance of the VisibleTodoList container will get its own mapStateToProps function with a private getVisibleTodos selector. Memoization will now work correctly regardless of the render order of the VisibleTodoList containers.\ncontainers\/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '..\/actions'\nimport TodoList from '..\/components\/TodoList'\nimport { makeGetVisibleTodos } from '..\/selectors'\n\nconst makeMapStateToProps = () => {\n  const getVisibleTodos = makeGetVisibleTodos()\n  const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n    return {\n      todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n    }\n  }\n  return mapStateToProps\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  makeMapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nAPI\ncreateSelector(...inputSelectors | [inputSelectors], resultFunc)\nTakes one or more selectors, or an array of selectors, computes their values and passes them as arguments to resultFunc.\ncreateSelector determines if the value returned by an input-selector has changed between calls using reference equality (===). Inputs to selectors created with createSelector should be immutable.\nSelectors created with createSelector have a cache size of 1. This means they always recalculate when the value of an input-selector changes, as a selector only stores the preceding value of each input-selector.\nconst mySelector = createSelector(\n  state => state.values.value1,\n  state => state.values.value2,\n  (value1, value2) => value1 + value2\n)\n\n\/\/ You can also pass an array of selectors\nconst totalSelector = createSelector(\n  [\n    state => state.values.value1,\n    state => state.values.value2\n  ],\n  (value1, value2) => value1 + value2\n)\nIt can be useful to access the props of a component from within a selector. When a selector is connected to a component with connect, the component props are passed as the second argument to the selector:\nconst abSelector = (state, props) => state.a * props.b\n\n\/\/ props only (ignoring state argument)\nconst cSelector =  (_, props) => props.c\n\n\/\/ state only (props argument omitted as not required)\nconst dSelector = state => state.d\n\nconst totalSelector = createSelector(\n  abSelector,\n  cSelector,\n  dSelector,\n  (ab, c, d) => ({\n    total: ab + c + d\n  })\n)\ndefaultMemoize(func, equalityCheck = defaultEqualityCheck)\ndefaultMemoize memoizes the function passed in the func parameter. It is the memoize function used by createSelector.\ndefaultMemoize has a cache size of 1. This means it always recalculates when the value of an argument changes.\ndefaultMemoize determines if an argument has changed by calling the equalityCheck function. As defaultMemoize is designed to be used with immutable data, the default equalityCheck function checks for changes using reference equality:\nfunction defaultEqualityCheck(previousVal, currentVal) {\n  return currentVal === previousVal\n}\ndefaultMemoize can be used with createSelectorCreator to customize the equalityCheck function.\ncreateSelectorCreator(memoize, ...memoizeOptions)\ncreateSelectorCreator can be used to make a customized version of createSelector.\nThe memoize argument is a memoization function to replace defaultMemoize.\nThe ...memoizeOptions rest parameters are zero or more configuration options to be passed to memoizeFunc. The selectors resultFunc is passed as the first argument to memoize and the memoizeOptions are passed as the second argument onwards:\nconst customSelectorCreator = createSelectorCreator(\n  customMemoize, \/\/ function to be used to memoize resultFunc\n  option1, \/\/ option1 will be passed as second argument to customMemoize\n  option2, \/\/ option2 will be passed as third argument to customMemoize\n  option3 \/\/ option3 will be passed as fourth argument to customMemoize\n)\n\nconst customSelector = customSelectorCreator(\n  input1,\n  input2,\n  resultFunc \/\/ resultFunc will be passed as first argument to customMemoize\n)\nInternally customSelector calls the memoize function as follows:\ncustomMemoize(resultFunc, option1, option2, option3)\nHere are some examples of how you might use createSelectorCreator:\nCustomize equalityCheck for defaultMemoize\nimport { createSelectorCreator, defaultMemoize } from 'reselect'\nimport isEqual from 'lodash.isequal'\n\n\/\/ create a \"selector creator\" that uses lodash.isequal instead of ===\nconst createDeepEqualSelector = createSelectorCreator(\n  defaultMemoize,\n  isEqual\n)\n\n\/\/ use the new \"selector creator\" to create a selector\nconst mySelector = createDeepEqualSelector(\n  state => state.values.filter(val => val < 5),\n  values => values.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0)\n)\nUse memoize function from lodash for an unbounded cache\nimport { createSelectorCreator } from 'reselect'\nimport memoize from 'lodash.memoize'\n\nlet called = 0\nconst hashFn = (...args) => args.reduce(\n  (acc, val) => acc + '-' + JSON.stringify(val),\n  ''\n)\nconst customSelectorCreator = createSelectorCreator(memoize, hashFn)\nconst selector = customSelectorCreator(\n  state => state.a,\n  state => state.b,\n  (a, b) => {\n    called++\n    return a + b\n  }\n)\ncreateStructuredSelector({inputSelectors}, selectorCreator = createSelector)\ncreateStructuredSelector is a convenience function for a common pattern that arises when using Reselect. The selector passed to a connect decorator often just takes the values of its input-selectors and maps them to keys in an object:\nconst mySelectorA = state => state.a\nconst mySelectorB = state => state.b\n\n\/\/ The result function in the following selector\n\/\/ is simply building an object from the input selectors\nconst structuredSelector = createSelector(\n   mySelectorA,\n   mySelectorB,\n   (a, b) => ({\n     a,\n     b\n   })\n)\ncreateStructuredSelector takes an object whose properties are input-selectors and returns a structured selector. The structured selector returns an object with the same keys as the inputSelectors argument, but with the selectors replaced with their values.\nconst mySelectorA = state => state.a\nconst mySelectorB = state => state.b\n\nconst structuredSelector = createStructuredSelector({\n  x: mySelectorA,\n  y: mySelectorB\n})\n\nconst result = structuredSelector({ a: 1, b: 2 }) \/\/ will produce { x: 1, y: 2 }\nStructured selectors can be nested:\nconst nestedSelector = createStructuredSelector({\n  subA: createStructuredSelector({\n    selectorA,\n    selectorB\n  }),\n  subB: createStructuredSelector({\n    selectorC,\n    selectorD\n  })\n})\nFAQ\nQ: Why isn\u2019t my selector recomputing when the input state changes?\nA: Check that your memoization function is compatible with your state update function (i.e. the reducer if you are using Redux). For example, a selector created with createSelector will not work with a state update function that mutates an existing object instead of creating a new one each time. createSelector uses an identity check (===) to detect that an input has changed, so mutating an existing object will not trigger the selector to recompute because mutating an object does not change its identity. Note that if you are using Redux, mutating the state object is almost certainly a mistake.\nThe following example defines a simple selector that determines if the first todo item in an array of todos has been completed:\nconst isFirstTodoCompleteSelector = createSelector(\n  state => state.todos[0],\n  todo => todo && todo.completed\n)\nThe following state update function will not work with isFirstTodoCompleteSelector:\nexport default function todos(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case COMPLETE_ALL:\n    const areAllMarked = state.every(todo => todo.completed)\n    \/\/ BAD: mutating an existing object\n    return state.map(todo => {\n      todo.completed = !areAllMarked\n      return todo\n    })\n\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\nThe following state update function will work with isFirstTodoCompleteSelector:\nexport default function todos(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case COMPLETE_ALL:\n    const areAllMarked = state.every(todo => todo.completed)\n    \/\/ GOOD: returning a new object each time with Object.assign\n    return state.map(todo => Object.assign({}, todo, {\n      completed: !areAllMarked\n    }))\n\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\nIf you are not using Redux and have a requirement to work with mutable data, you can use createSelectorCreator to replace the default memoization function and\/or use a different equality check function. See here and here for examples.\nQ: Why is my selector recomputing when the input state stays the same?\nA: Check that your memoization function is compatible with your state update function (i.e. the reducer if you are using Redux). For example, a selector created with createSelector that recomputes unexpectedly may be receiving a new object on each update whether the values it contains have changed or not. createSelector uses an identity check (===) to detect that an input has changed, so returning a new object on each update means that the selector will recompute on each update.\nimport { REMOVE_OLD } from '..\/constants\/ActionTypes'\n\nconst initialState = [\n  {\n    text: 'Use Redux',\n    completed: false,\n    id: 0,\n    timestamp: Date.now()\n  }\n]\n\nexport default function todos(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case REMOVE_OLD:\n    return state.filter(todo => {\n      return todo.timestamp + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 > Date.now()\n    })\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\nThe following selector is going to recompute every time REMOVE_OLD is invoked because Array.filter always returns a new object. However, in the majority of cases the REMOVE_OLD action will not change the list of todos so the recomputation is unnecessary.\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst todosSelector = state => state.todos\n\nexport const visibleTodosSelector = createSelector(\n  todosSelector,\n  (todos) => {\n    ...\n  }\n)\nYou can eliminate unnecessary recomputations by returning a new object from the state update function only when a deep equality check has found that the list of todos has actually changed:\nimport { REMOVE_OLD } from '..\/constants\/ActionTypes'\nimport isEqual from 'lodash.isequal'\n\nconst initialState = [\n  {\n    text: 'Use Redux',\n    completed: false,\n    id: 0,\n    timestamp: Date.now()\n  }\n]\n\nexport default function todos(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case REMOVE_OLD:\n    const updatedState =  state.filter(todo => {\n      return todo.timestamp + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 > Date.now()\n    })\n    return isEqual(updatedState, state) ? state : updatedState\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\nAlternatively, the default equalityCheck function in the selector can be replaced by a deep equality check:\nimport { createSelectorCreator, defaultMemoize } from 'reselect'\nimport isEqual from 'lodash.isequal'\n\nconst todosSelector = state => state.todos\n\n\/\/ create a \"selector creator\" that uses lodash.isequal instead of ===\nconst createDeepEqualSelector = createSelectorCreator(\n  defaultMemoize,\n  isEqual\n)\n\n\/\/ use the new \"selector creator\" to create a selector\nconst mySelector = createDeepEqualSelector(\n  todosSelector,\n  (todos) => {\n    ...\n  }\n)\nAlways check that the cost of an alternative equalityCheck function or deep equality check in the state update function is not greater than the cost of recomputing every time. If recomputing every time does work out to be the cheaper option, it may be that for this case Reselect is not giving you any benefit over passing a plain mapStateToProps function to connect.\nQ: Can I use Reselect without Redux?\nA: Yes. Reselect has no dependencies on any other package, so although it was designed to be used with Redux it can be used independently. It is currently being used successfully in traditional Flux apps.\n\nIf you create selectors using createSelector make sure its arguments are immutable.\nSee here\n\nQ: How do I create a selector that takes an argument?\nA: Keep in mind that selectors can access React props, so if your arguments are (or can be made available as) React props, you can use that functionality. See here for details.\nOtherwise, Reselect doesn't have built-in support for creating selectors that accepts arguments, but here are some suggestions for implementing similar functionality...\nIf the argument is not dynamic you can use a factory function:\nconst expensiveItemSelectorFactory = minValue => {\n  return createSelector(\n    shopItemsSelector,\n    items => items.filter(item => item.value > minValue)\n  )\n}\n\nconst subtotalSelector = createSelector(\n  expensiveItemSelectorFactory(200),\n  items => items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0)\n)\nThe general consensus here and over at nuclear-js is that if a selector needs a dynamic argument, then that argument should probably be state in the store. If you decide that you do require a selector with a dynamic argument, then a selector that returns a memoized function may be suitable:\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\nimport memoize from 'lodash.memoize'\n\nconst expensiveSelector = createSelector(\n  state => state.items,\n  items => memoize(\n    minValue => items.filter(item => item.value > minValue)\n  )\n)\n\nconst expensiveFilter = expensiveSelector(state)\n\nconst slightlyExpensive = expensiveFilter(100)\nconst veryExpensive = expensiveFilter(1000000)\nQ: The default memoization function is no good, can I use a different one?\nA: We think it works great for a lot of use cases, but sure. See these examples.\nQ: How do I test a selector?\nA: For a given input, a selector should always produce the same output. For this reason they are simple to unit test.\nconst selector = createSelector(\n  state => state.a,\n  state => state.b,\n  (a, b) => ({\n    c: a * 2,\n    d: b * 3\n  })\n)\n\ntest(\"selector unit test\", () => {\n  assert.deepEqual(selector({ a: 1, b: 2 }), { c: 2, d: 6 })\n  assert.deepEqual(selector({ a: 2, b: 3 }), { c: 4, d: 9 })\n})\nIt may also be useful to check that the memoization function for a selector works correctly with the state update function (i.e. the reducer if you are using Redux). Each selector has a recomputations method that will return the number of times it has been recomputed:\nsuite('selector', () => {\n  let state = { a: 1, b: 2 }\n\n  const reducer = (state, action) => (\n    {\n      a: action(state.a),\n      b: action(state.b)\n    }\n  )\n\n  const selector = createSelector(\n    state => state.a,\n    state => state.b,\n    (a, b) => ({\n      c: a * 2,\n      d: b * 3\n    })\n  )\n\n  const plusOne = x => x + 1\n  const id = x => x\n\n  test(\"selector unit test\", () => {\n    state = reducer(state, plusOne)\n    assert.deepEqual(selector(state), { c: 4, d: 9 })\n    state = reducer(state, id)\n    assert.deepEqual(selector(state), { c: 4, d: 9 })\n    assert.equal(selector.recomputations(), 1)\n    state = reducer(state, plusOne)\n    assert.deepEqual(selector(state), { c: 6, d: 12 })\n    assert.equal(selector.recomputations(), 2)\n  })\n})\nAdditionally, selectors keep a reference to the last result function as .resultFunc. If you have selectors composed of many other selectors this can help you test each selector without coupling all of your tests to the shape of your state.\nFor example if you have a set of selectors like this:\nselectors.js\nexport const firstSelector = createSelector( ... )\nexport const secondSelector = createSelector( ... )\nexport const thirdSelector = createSelector( ... )\n\nexport const myComposedSelector = createSelector(\n  firstSelector,\n  secondSelector,\n  thirdSelector,\n  (first, second, third) => first * second < third\n)\nAnd then a set of unit tests like this:\ntest\/selectors.js\n\/\/ tests for the first three selectors...\ntest(\"firstSelector unit test\", () => { ... })\ntest(\"secondSelector unit test\", () => { ... })\ntest(\"thirdSelector unit test\", () => { ... })\n\n\/\/ We have already tested the previous\n\/\/ three selector outputs so we can just call `.resultFunc`\n\/\/ with the values we want to test directly:\ntest(\"myComposedSelector unit test\", () => {\n  \/\/ here instead of calling selector()\n  \/\/ we just call selector.resultFunc()\n  assert(myComposedSelector.resultFunc(1, 2, 3), true)\n  assert(myComposedSelector.resultFunc(2, 2, 1), false)\n})\nFinally, each selector has a resetRecomputations method that sets\nrecomputations back to 0.  The intended use is for a complex selector that may\nhave many independent tests and you don't want to manually manage the\ncomputation count or create a \"dummy\" selector for each test.\nQ: How do I use Reselect with Immutable.js?\nA: Selectors created with createSelector should work just fine with Immutable.js data structures.\nIf your selector is recomputing and you don't think the state has changed, make sure you are aware of which Immutable.js update methods always return a new object and which update methods only return a new object when the collection actually changes.\nimport Immutable from 'immutable'\n\nlet myMap = Immutable.Map({\n  a: 1,\n  b: 2,\n  c: 3\n})\n\n \/\/ set, merge and others only return a new obj when update changes collection\nlet newMap = myMap.set('a', 1)\nassert.equal(myMap, newMap)\nnewMap = myMap.merge({ 'a': 1 })\nassert.equal(myMap, newMap)\n\/\/ map, reduce, filter and others always return a new obj\nnewMap = myMap.map(a => a * 1)\nassert.notEqual(myMap, newMap)\nIf a selector's input is updated by an operation that always returns a new object, it may be performing unnecessary recomputations. See here for a discussion on the pros and cons of using a deep equality check like Immutable.is to eliminate unnecessary recomputations.\nQ: Can I share a selector across multiple component instances?\nA: Selectors created using createSelector only have a cache size of one. This can make them unsuitable for sharing across multiple instances if the arguments to the selector are different for each instance of the component. There are a couple of ways to get around this:\n\n\nCreate a factory function which returns a new selector for each instance of the component. There is built-in support for factory functions in React Redux v4.3 or higher. See here for an example.\n\n\nCreate a custom selector with a cache size greater than one.\n\n\nQ: Are there TypeScript Typings?\nA: Yes! They are included and referenced in package.json. They should Just Work\u2122.\nQ: How can I make a curried selector?\nA: Try these helper functions courtesy of MattSPalmer\nRelated Projects\nre-reselect\nEnhances Reselect selectors by wrapping createSelector and returning a memoized collection of selectors indexed with the cache key returned by a custom resolver function.\nUseful to reduce selectors recalculation when the same selector is repeatedly called with one\/few different arguments.\nreselect-tools\nChrome extension and companion lib for debugging selectors.\n\nMeasure selector recomputations across the app and identify performance bottlenecks\nCheck selector dependencies, inputs, outputs, and recomputations at any time with the chrome extension\nStatically export a JSON representation of your selector graph for further analysis\n\nreselect-map\nCan be useful when doing very expensive computations on elements of a collection because Reselect might not give you the granularity of caching that you need. Check out the reselect-maps README for examples.\nThe optimizations in reselect-map only apply in a small number of cases. If you are unsure whether you need it, you don't!\nLicense\nMIT\n","109":"\nMark Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Next generation markdown editor \ud83c\udf19\n  A simple and elegant open-source markdown editor that focused on speed and usability.\nAvailable for Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Website\n    \n | \n\n      Features\n    \n | \n\n      Downloads\n    \n | \n\n      Development\n    \n | \n\n      Contribution\n    \n\n\n\nTranslations:\n\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\n\n\n\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc\n\n\n\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1\n\n\n\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\n\n\n\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\n\n\n\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7\n\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\n\n\n\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9\n\n\n\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7\n\n\n\nThis Markdown editor that could.

I have used a lot of markdown editors, yet there is still not an editor that can fully meet my needs. I don't like to be disturbed when I write by some unbearable bug. Mark Text uses virtual DOM to render pages which has the added benefits of being highly efficient and being open source. That way anyone who loves markdown and writing can use Mark Text.\nAs mentioned above, Mark Text is completely free and open source and will be open source forever. We hope that all markdown lovers will contribute their own code and help develop Mark Text into a popular markdown editor.\nThere are many markdown editors and all have their own merits, some have features which others don't. It's difficult to satisfy each markdown users' needs but we hope Mark Text will be able to satisfy each markdown user as much as possible. Although the latest Mark Text is still not perfect, we will try to make it as best as we possibly can.\n\nDownload and Installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to see new features of the latest version?

For those using Vercel, this means that there is no requirement to use pkg in your projects as the benefits it provides are not applicable to the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command line interface enables you to package your Node.js project into an executable that can be run even on devices without Node.js installed.\nUse Cases\n\nMake a commercial version of your application without sources\nMake a demo\/evaluation\/trial version of your app without sources\nInstantly make executables for other platforms (cross-compilation)\nMake some kind of self-extracting archive or installer\nNo need to install Node.js and npm to run the packaged application\nNo need to download hundreds of files via npm install to deploy\nyour application. Deploy it as a single file\nPut your assets inside the executable to make it even more portable\nTest your app against new Node.js version without installing it\n\nUsage\nnpm install -g pkg\nAfter installing it, run pkg --help without arguments to see list of options.\nThe entrypoint of your project is a mandatory CLI argument. It may be:\n\nPath to entry file. Suppose it is \/path\/app.js, then\npackaged app will work the same way as node \/path\/app.js\nPath to package.json. Pkg will follow bin property of\nthe specified package.json and use it as entry file.\nPath to directory. Pkg will look for package.json in\nthe specified directory. See above.\n\nTargets\npkg can generate executables for several target machines at a\ntime. You can specify a comma-separated list of targets via --targets\noption. A canonical target consists of 3 elements, separated by\ndashes, for example node6-macos-x64 or node4-linux-armv6:\n\nnodeRange node${n} or latest\nplatform freebsd, linux, alpine, macos, win\narch x64, x86, armv6, armv7\n\nYou may omit any element (and specify just node6 for example).\nThe omitted elements will be taken from current platform or\nsystem-wide Node.js installation (its version and arch).\nThere is also an alias host, that means that all 3 elements\nare taken from current platform\/Node.js. By default targets are\nlinux,macos,win for current Node.js version and arch.\nConfig\nDuring packaging process pkg parses your sources, detects\ncalls to require, traverses the dependencies of your project\nand includes them into executable. In most cases you\ndon't need to specify anything manually. However your code\nmay have require(variable) calls (so called non-literal\nargument to require) or use non-javascript files (for\nexample views, css, images etc).\n  require('.\/build\/' + cmd + '.js')\n  path.join(__dirname, 'views\/' + viewName)\nSuch cases are not handled by pkg. So you must specify the\nfiles - scripts and assets - manually in pkg property of\nyour package.json file.\n  \"pkg\": {\n    \"scripts\": \"build\/**\/*.js\",\n    \"assets\": \"views\/**\/*\"\n  }\nYou may also specify arrays of globs:\n    \"assets\": [ \"assets\/**\/*\", \"images\/**\/*\" ]\n\nJust be sure to call pkg package.json or pkg . to make use\nof scripts and assets entries.\nScripts\nscripts is a glob\nor list of globs. Files specified as scripts will be compiled\nusing v8::ScriptCompiler and placed into executable without\nsources. They must conform to the JS standards of those Node.js versions\nyou target (see Targets), i.e. be already transpiled.\nAssets\nassets is a glob\nor list of globs. Files specified as assets will be packaged\ninto executable as raw content without modifications. Javascript\nfiles may also be specified as assets. Their sources will\nnot be stripped as it improves execution performance of the\nfiles and simplifies debugging.\nSee also\nDetecting assets in source code and\nSnapshot filesystem.\nOptions\nNode.js application can be called with runtime options\n(belonging to Node.js or V8). To list them type node --help or\nnode --v8-options. You can \"bake\" these runtime options into\npackaged application. The app will always run with the options\nturned on. Just remove -- from option name.\npkg app.js --options expose-gc\npkg app.js --options max_old_space_size=4096\nOutput\nYou may specify --output if you create only one executable\nor --out-path to place executables for multiple targets.\nDebug\nPass --debug to pkg to get a log of packaging process.\nIf you have issues with some particular file (seems not packaged\ninto executable), it may be useful to look through the log.\nBuild\npkg has so called \"base binaries\" - they are actually same\nnode executables but with some patches applied. They are\nused as a base for every executable pkg creates. pkg\ndownloads precompiled base binaries before packaging your\napplication. If you prefer to compile base binaries from\nsource instead of downloading them, you may pass --build\noption to pkg. First ensure your computer meets the\nrequirements to compile original Node.js:\nBUILDING.md\nUsage of packaged app\nCommand line call to packaged app .\/app a b is equivalent\nto node app.js a b\nSnapshot filesystem\nDuring packaging process pkg collects project files and places\nthem into executable. It is called a snapshot. At run time the\npackaged application has access to snapshot filesystem where all\nthat files reside.\nPackaged files have \/snapshot\/ prefix in their paths (or\nC:\\snapshot\\ in Windows). If you used pkg \/path\/app.js command line,\nthen __filename value will be likely \/snapshot\/path\/app.js\nat run time. __dirname will be \/snapshot\/path as well. Here is\nthe comparison table of path-related values:\n\n\n\nvalue\nwith node\npackaged\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n__filename\n\/project\/app.js\n\/snapshot\/project\/app.js\n\n\n\n__dirname\n\/project\n\/snapshot\/project\n\n\n\nprocess.cwd()\n\/project\n\/deploy\nsuppose the app is called ...\n\n\nprocess.execPath\n\/usr\/bin\/nodejs\n\/deploy\/app-x64\napp-x64 and run in \/deploy\n\n\nprocess.argv[0]\n\/usr\/bin\/nodejs\n\/deploy\/app-x64\n\n\n\nprocess.argv[1]\n\/project\/app.js\n\/snapshot\/project\/app.js\n\n\n\nprocess.pkg.entrypoint\nundefined\n\/snapshot\/project\/app.js\n\n\n\nprocess.pkg.defaultEntrypoint\nundefined\n\/snapshot\/project\/app.js\n\n\n\nrequire.main.filename\n\/project\/app.js\n\/snapshot\/project\/app.js\n\n\n\n\nHence, in order to make use of a file collected at packaging\ntime (require a javascript file or serve an asset) you should\ntake __filename, __dirname, process.pkg.defaultEntrypoint\nor require.main.filename as a base for your path calculations.\nFor javascript files you can just require or require.resolve\nbecause they use current __dirname by default. For assets use\npath.join(__dirname, '..\/path\/to\/asset'). Learn more about\npath.join in\nDetecting assets in source code.\nOn the other hand, in order to access real file system at run time\n(pick up a user's external javascript plugin, json configuration or\neven get a list of user's directory) you should take process.cwd()\nor path.dirname(process.execPath).\nDetecting assets in source code\nWhen pkg encounters path.join(__dirname, '..\/path\/to\/asset'),\nit automatically packages the file specified as an asset. See\nAssets. Pay attention that path.join must have two\narguments and the last one must be a string literal.\nThis way you may even avoid creating pkg config for your project.\nNative addons\nNative addons (.node files) use is supported, but packaging\n.node files inside the executable is not resolved yet. You have\nto deploy native addons used by your project to the same directory\nas the executable.\nWhen a package, that contains a native module, is being installed,\nthe native module is compiled against current system-wide Node.js\nversion. Then, when you compile your project with pkg, pay attention\nto --target option. You should specify the same Node.js version\nas your system-wide Node.js to make compiled executable compatible\nwith .node files.\nAPI\nconst { exec } = require('pkg')\nexec(args) takes an array of command line arguments and returns\na promise. For example:\nawait exec([ 'app.js', '--target', 'host', '--output', 'app.exe' ])\n\/\/ do something with app.exe, run, test, upload, deploy, etc\nTroubleshooting\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_chdir\nThis error can be caused by deleting the directory the application is\nrun from. Or, generally, deleting process.cwd() directory when the\napplication is running.\n","113":"pjax = pushState + ajax\npjax is a jQuery plugin that uses ajax and pushState to deliver a fast browsing experience with real permalinks, page titles, and a working back button.\npjax works by fetching HTML from your server via ajax and replacing the content\nof a container element on your page with the loaded HTML. It then updates the\ncurrent URL in the browser using pushState. This results in faster page\nnavigation for two reasons:\n\nNo page resources (JS, CSS) get re-executed or re-applied;\nIf the server is configured for pjax, it can render only partial page\ncontents and thus avoid the potentially costly full layout render.\n\nStatus of this project\njquery-pjax is largely unmaintained at this point. It might continue to\nreceive important bug fixes, but its feature set is frozen and it's unlikely\nthat it will get new features or enhancements.\nInstallation\npjax depends on jQuery 1.8 or higher.\nnpm\n$ npm install jquery-pjax\n\nstandalone script\nDownload and include jquery.pjax.js in your web page:\ncurl -LO https:\/\/raw.github.com\/defunkt\/jquery-pjax\/master\/jquery.pjax.js\n\nUsage\n$.fn.pjax\nThe simplest and most common use of pjax looks like this:\n$(document).pjax('a', '#pjax-container')\nThis will enable pjax on all links on the page and designate the container as #pjax-container.\nIf you are migrating an existing site, you probably don't want to enable pjax\neverywhere just yet. Instead of using a global selector like a, try annotating\npjaxable links with data-pjax, then use 'a[data-pjax]' as your selector. Or,\ntry this selector that matches any <a data-pjax href=> links inside a <div data-pjax> container:\n$(document).pjax('[data-pjax] a, a[data-pjax]', '#pjax-container')\nServer-side configuration\nIdeally, your server should detect pjax requests by looking at the special\nX-PJAX HTTP header, and render only the HTML meant to replace the contents of\nthe container element (#pjax-container in our example) without the rest of\nthe page layout. Here is an example of how this might be done in Ruby on Rails:\ndef index\n  if request.headers['X-PJAX']\n    render :layout => false\n  end\nend\nIf you'd like a more automatic solution than pjax for Rails check out Turbolinks.\nCheck if there is a pjax plugin for your favorite server framework.\nAlso check out RailsCasts #294: Playing with PJAX.\nArguments\nThe synopsis for the $.fn.pjax function is:\n$(document).pjax(selector, [container], options)\n\nselector is a string to be used for click event delegation.\ncontainer is a string selector that uniquely identifies the pjax container.\noptions is an object with keys described below.\n\npjax options\n\n\n\nkey\ndefault\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ntimeout\n650\najax timeout in milliseconds after which a full refresh is forced\n\n\npush\ntrue\nuse pushState to add a browser history entry upon navigation\n\n\nreplace\nfalse\nreplace URL without adding browser history entry\n\n\nmaxCacheLength\n20\nmaximum cache size for previous container contents\n\n\nversion\n\na string or function returning the current pjax version\n\n\nscrollTo\n0\nvertical position to scroll to after navigation.

It allows you to get a little more control over the pjax event handling.\nThis example uses the current click context to set an ancestor element as the container:\nif ($.support.pjax) {\n  $(document).on('click', 'a[data-pjax]', function(event) {\n    var container = $(this).closest('[data-pjax-container]')\n    var containerSelector = '#' + container.id\n    $.pjax.click(event, {container: containerSelector})\n  })\n}\nNOTE Use the explicit $.support.pjax guard. We aren't using $.fn.pjax so we should avoid binding this event handler unless the browser is actually going to use pjax.\n$.pjax.submit\nSubmits a form via pjax.\n$(document).on('submit', 'form[data-pjax]', function(event) {\n  $.pjax.submit(event, '#pjax-container')\n})\n$.pjax.reload\nInitiates a request for the current URL to the server using pjax mechanism and replaces the container with the response. Does not add a browser history entry.\n$.pjax.reload('#pjax-container', options)\n$.pjax\nManual pjax invocation. Used mainly when you want to start a pjax request in a handler that didn't originate from a click. If you can get access to a click event, consider $.pjax.click(event) instead.\nfunction applyFilters() {\n  var url = urlForFilters()\n  $.pjax({url: url, container: '#pjax-container'})\n}\nEvents\nAll pjax events except pjax:click & pjax:clicked are fired from the pjax\ncontainer element.\n\n\nevent\ncancel\narguments\nnotes\n\n\nevent lifecycle upon following a pjaxed link\n\n\npjax:click\n\u2714\ufe0e\noptions\nfires from a link that got activated; cancel to prevent pjax\n\n\npjax:beforeSend\n\u2714\ufe0e\nxhr, options\ncan set XHR headers\n\n\npjax:start\n\nxhr, options\n\n\n\npjax:send\n\nxhr, options\n\n\n\npjax:clicked\n\noptions\nfires after pjax has started from a link that got clicked\n\n\npjax:beforeReplace\n\ncontents, options\nbefore replacing HTML with content loaded from the server\n\n\npjax:success\n\ndata, status, xhr, options\nafter replacing HTML content loaded from the server\n\n\npjax:timeout\n\u2714\ufe0e\nxhr, options\nfires after options.timeout; will hard refresh unless canceled\n\n\npjax:error\n\u2714\ufe0e\nxhr, textStatus, error, options\non ajax error; will hard refresh unless canceled\n\n\npjax:complete\n\nxhr, textStatus, options\nalways fires after ajax, regardless of result\n\n\npjax:end\n\nxhr, options\n\n\n\nevent lifecycle on browser Back\/Forward navigation\n\n\npjax:popstate\n\n\nevent direction property: \"back\"\/\"forward\"\n\n\npjax:start\n\nnull, options\nbefore replacing content\n\n\npjax:beforeReplace\n\ncontents, options\nright before replacing HTML with content from cache\n\n\npjax:end\n\nnull, options\nafter replacing content\n\n\npjax:send & pjax:complete are a good pair of events to use if you are implementing a\nloading indicator. They'll only be triggered if an actual XHR request is made,\nnot if the content is loaded from cache:\n$(document).on('pjax:send', function() {\n  $('#loading').show()\n})\n$(document).on('pjax:complete', function() {\n  $('#loading').hide()\n})\nAn example of canceling a pjax:timeout event would be to disable the fallback\ntimeout behavior if a spinner is being shown:\n$(document).on('pjax:timeout', function(event) {\n  \/\/ Prevent default timeout redirection behavior\n  event.preventDefault()\n})\nAdvanced configuration\nReinitializing plugins\/widget on new page content\nThe whole point of pjax is that it fetches and inserts new content without\nrefreshing the page. However, other jQuery plugins or libraries that are set to\nreact on page loaded event (such as DOMContentLoaded) will not pick up on\nthese changes. Therefore, it's usually a good idea to configure these plugins to\nreinitialize in the scope of the updated page content. This can be done like so:\n$(document).on('ready pjax:end', function(event) {\n  $(event.target).initializeMyPlugin()\n})\nThis will make $.fn.initializeMyPlugin() be called at the document level on\nnormal page load, and on the container level after any pjax navigation (either\nafter clicking on a link or going Back in the browser).\nResponse types that force a reload\nBy default, pjax will force a full reload of the page if it receives one of the\nfollowing responses from the server:\n\n\nPage content that includes <html> when fragment selector wasn't explicitly\nconfigured. Pjax presumes that the server's response hasn't been properly\nconfigured for pjax. If fragment pjax option is given, pjax will extract the\ncontent based on that selector.\n\n\nPage content that is blank.

This may not be strictly necessary depending on how you're using the library.\nCDN\nAlternatively, include it via jsDelivr CDN:\nUMD:\n<script src=\"https:\/\/cdn.jsdelivr.net\/npm\/js-cookie@rc\/dist\/js.cookie.min.js\"><\/script>\nES module:\n<script\n  type=\"module\"\n  src=\"https:\/\/cdn.jsdelivr.net\/npm\/js-cookie@rc\/dist\/js.cookie.min.mjs\"\n><\/script>\nES Module\nExample for how to import the ES module from another module:\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie'\n\nCookies.set('foo', 'bar')\nBasic Usage\nCreate a cookie, valid across the entire site:\nCookies.set('name', 'value')\nCreate a cookie that expires 7 days from now, valid across the entire site:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { expires: 7 })\nCreate an expiring cookie, valid to the path of the current page:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { expires: 7, path: '' })\nRead cookie:\nCookies.get('name') \/\/ => 'value'\nCookies.get('nothing') \/\/ => undefined\nRead all visible cookies:\nCookies.get() \/\/ => { name: 'value' }\nNote: It is not possible to read a particular cookie by passing one of the cookie attributes (which may or may not\nhave been used when writing the cookie in question):\nCookies.get('foo', { domain: 'sub.example.com' }) \/\/ `domain` won't have any effect...!\nThe cookie with the name foo will only be available on .get() if it's visible from where the\ncode is called; the domain and\/or path attribute will not have an effect when reading.\nDelete cookie:\nCookies.remove('name')\nDelete a cookie valid to the path of the current page:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { path: '' })\nCookies.remove('name') \/\/ fail!\nCookies.remove('name', { path: '' }) \/\/ removed!\nIMPORTANT! When deleting a cookie and you're not relying on the default attributes, you must pass the exact same path and domain attributes that were used to set the cookie:\nCookies.remove('name', { path: '', domain: '.yourdomain.com' })\nNote: Removing a nonexistent cookie neither raises any exception nor returns any value.\nNamespace conflicts\nIf there is any danger of a conflict with the namespace Cookies, the noConflict method will allow you to define a new namespace and preserve the original one. This is especially useful when running the script on third party sites e.g. as part of a widget or SDK.\n\/\/ Assign the js-cookie api to a different variable and restore the original \"window.Cookies\"\nvar Cookies2 = Cookies.noConflict()\nCookies2.set('name', 'value')\nNote: The .noConflict method is not necessary when using AMD or CommonJS, thus it is not exposed in those environments.\nEncoding\nThis project is RFC 6265 compliant. All special characters that are not allowed in the cookie-name or cookie-value are encoded with each one's UTF-8 Hex equivalent using percent-encoding.\nThe only character in cookie-name or cookie-value that is allowed and still encoded is the percent % character, it is escaped in order to interpret percent input as literal.\nPlease note that the default encoding\/decoding strategy is meant to be interoperable only between cookies that are read\/written by js-cookie. To override the default encoding\/decoding strategy you need to use a converter.\nNote: According to RFC 6265, your cookies may get deleted if they are too big or there are too many cookies in the same domain, more details here.\nCookie Attributes\nCookie attribute defaults can be set globally by creating an instance of the api via withAttributes(), or individually for each call to Cookies.set(...) by passing a plain object as the last argument. Per-call attributes override the default attributes.\nexpires\nDefine when the cookie will be removed. Value must be a Number which will be interpreted as days from time of creation or a Date instance. If omitted, the cookie becomes a session cookie.\nTo create a cookie that expires in less than a day, you can check the FAQ on the Wiki.\nDefault: Cookie is removed when the user closes the browser.\nExamples:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { expires: 365 })\nCookies.get('name') \/\/ => 'value'\nCookies.remove('name')\npath\nA String indicating the path where the cookie is visible.\nDefault: \/\nExamples:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { path: '' })\nCookies.get('name') \/\/ => 'value'\nCookies.remove('name', { path: '' })\nNote regarding Internet Explorer:\n\nDue to an obscure bug in the underlying WinINET InternetGetCookie implementation, IE\u2019s document.cookie will not return a cookie if it was set with a path attribute containing a filename.\n\n(From Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ))\nThis means one cannot set a path using window.location.pathname in case such pathname contains a filename like so: \/check.html (or at least, such cookie cannot be read correctly).\nIn fact, you should never allow untrusted input to set the cookie attributes or you might be exposed to a XSS attack.\ndomain\nA String indicating a valid domain where the cookie should be visible. The cookie will also be visible to all subdomains.\nDefault: Cookie is visible only to the domain or subdomain of the page where the cookie was created, except for Internet Explorer (see below).\nExamples:\nAssuming a cookie that is being created on site.com:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { domain: 'subdomain.site.com' })\nCookies.get('name') \/\/ => undefined (need to read at 'subdomain.site.com')\nNote regarding Internet Explorer default behavior:\n\nQ3: If I don\u2019t specify a DOMAIN attribute (for) a cookie, IE sends it to all nested subdomains anyway?\nA: Yes, a cookie set on example.com will be sent to sub2.sub1.example.com.\nInternet Explorer differs from other browsers in this regard.\n\n(From Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ))\nThis means that if you omit the domain attribute, it will be visible for a subdomain in IE.\nsecure\nEither true or false, indicating if the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol (https).\nDefault: No secure protocol requirement.\nExamples:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { secure: true })\nCookies.get('name') \/\/ => 'value'\nCookies.remove('name')\nsameSite\nA String, allowing to control whether the browser is sending a cookie along with cross-site requests.\nDefault: not set.\nNote that more recent browsers are making \"Lax\" the default value even without specifiying anything here.\nExamples:\nCookies.set('name', 'value', { sameSite: 'strict' })\nCookies.get('name') \/\/ => 'value'\nCookies.remove('name')\nSetting up defaults\nconst api = Cookies.withAttributes({ path: '\/', domain: '.example.com' })\nConverters\nRead\nCreate a new instance of the api that overrides the default decoding implementation.

We are targeting patch releases every 2 weeks.\nMinor Releases\nThe minor builds (1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.3.0) can contain breaking changes to CSS, APIs, and UX.\nOur formal release of minor builds is much less frequent. The release process for minor builds is currently\nbeing re-evaluated.\n\nFor the purposes of AngularJS Material, you could think of the patch releases as being minor changes,\nand the 'minor' releases as being major changes according to semver.\n\n Contributing\nDevelopers interested in contributing should read the following guidelines:\n\nIssue Guidelines\nContributing Guidelines\nCoding Guidelines\nPull Request Guide\nSoftware Process\nChange Log\n\n\nPlease do not ask general questions in an issue.

Please note that this may violate RFC 5321, which gives providers the possibility to treat the local part of email addresses in a case sensitive way (although in practice most - yet not all - providers don't). The domain part of the email address is always lowercased, as it's case insensitive per RFC 1035.gmail_lowercase: true - GMail addresses are known to be case-insensitive, so this switch allows lowercasing them even when all_lowercase is set to false. Please note that when all_lowercase is true, GMail addresses are lowercased regardless of the value of this setting.gmail_remove_dots: true: Removes dots from the local part of the email address, as GMail ignores them (e.g. \"john.doe\" and \"johndoe\" are considered equal).gmail_remove_subaddress: true: Normalizes addresses by removing \"sub-addresses\", which is the part following a \"+\" sign (e.g. \"foo+bar@gmail.com\" becomes \"foo@gmail.com\").gmail_convert_googlemaildotcom: true: Converts addresses with domain @googlemail.com to @gmail.com, as they're equivalent.outlookdotcom_lowercase: true - Outlook.com addresses (including Windows Live and Hotmail) are known to be case-insensitive, so this switch allows lowercasing them even when all_lowercase is set to false. Please note that when all_lowercase is true, Outlook.com addresses are lowercased regardless of the value of this setting.outlookdotcom_remove_subaddress: true: Normalizes addresses by removing \"sub-addresses\", which is the part following a \"+\" sign (e.g. \"foo+bar@outlook.com\" becomes \"foo@outlook.com\").yahoo_lowercase: true - Yahoo Mail addresses are known to be case-insensitive, so this switch allows lowercasing them even when all_lowercase is set to false. Please note that when all_lowercase is true, Yahoo Mail addresses are lowercased regardless of the value of this setting.yahoo_remove_subaddress: true: Normalizes addresses by removing \"sub-addresses\", which is the part following a \"-\" sign (e.g. \"foo-bar@yahoo.com\" becomes \"foo@yahoo.com\").icloud_lowercase: true - iCloud addresses (including MobileMe) are known to be case-insensitive, so this switch allows lowercasing them even when all_lowercase is set to false. Please note that when all_lowercase is true, iCloud addresses are lowercased regardless of the value of this setting.icloud_remove_subaddress: true: Normalizes addresses by removing \"sub-addresses\", which is the part following a \"+\" sign (e.g. \"foo+bar@icloud.com\" becomes \"foo@icloud.com\").\n\n\nrtrim(input [, chars])\ntrim characters from the right-side of the input.\n\n\nstripLow(input [, keep_new_lines])\nremove characters with a numerical value < 32 and 127, mostly control characters.

Everything except for '0', 'false' and '' returns true. In strict mode only '1' and 'true' return true.\n\n\ntoDate(input)\nconvert the input string to a date, or null if the input is not a date.\n\n\ntoFloat(input)\nconvert the input string to a float, or NaN if the input is not a float.\n\n\ntoInt(input [, radix])\nconvert the input string to an integer, or NaN if the input is not an integer.\n\n\ntrim(input [, chars])\ntrim characters (whitespace by default) from both sides of the input.\n\n\nunescape(input)\nreplaces HTML encoded entities with <, >, &, ', \" and \/.\n\n\nwhitelist(input, chars)\nremove characters that do not appear in the whitelist. The characters are used in a RegExp and so you will need to escape some chars, e.g. whitelist(input, '\\\\[\\\\]').\n\n\n\nXSS Sanitization\nXSS sanitization was removed from the library in 2d5d6999.\nFor an alternative, have a look at Yahoo's xss-filters library or at DOMPurify.\nContributing\nIn general, we follow the \"fork-and-pull\" Git workflow.\n\nFork the repo on GitHub\nClone the project to your own machine\nWork on your fork\n\nMake your changes and additions\n\nMost of your changes should be focused on src\/ and test\/ folders and\/or README.md.\nFiles such as validator.js, validator.min.js and files in lib\/ folder are autogenerated when running tests (npm test) and need not to be changed manually.\n\n\nChange or add tests if needed\nRun tests and make sure they pass\nAdd changes to README.md if needed\n\n\nCommit changes to your own branch\nMake sure you merge the latest from \"upstream\" and resolve conflicts if there is any\nRepeat step 3(3) above\nPush your work back up to your fork\nSubmit a Pull request so that we can review your changes\n\nTests\nTests are using mocha, to run the tests use:\n$ npm test\nMaintainers\n\nchriso - Chris O'Hara (author)\nprofnandaa - Anthony Nandaa\n\nReading\nRemember, validating can be troublesome sometimes.

Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far as we know, it is one of the fastest web frameworks in town.\nRequirements\nNode.js v10 LTS (10.16.0) or later.\nQuick start\nCreate a folder and make it your current working directory:\nmkdir my-app\ncd my-app\n\nGenerate a fastify project with npm init:\nnpm init fastify\nInstall dependencies:\nnpm install\nTo start the app in dev mode:\nnpm run dev\nFor production mode:\nnpm start\nUnder the hood npm init downloads and runs Fastify Create,\nwhich in turn uses the generate functionality of Fastify CLI.\nInstall\nIf installing in an existing project, then Fastify can be installed into the project as a dependency:\nInstall with npm:\nnpm i fastify --save\n\nInstall with yarn:\nyarn add fastify\n\nExample\n\/\/ Require the framework and instantiate it\nconst fastify = require('fastify')({\n  logger: true\n})\n\n\/\/ Declare a route\nfastify.get('\/', (request, reply) => {\n  reply.send({ hello: 'world' })\n})\n\n\/\/ Run the server!\nfastify.listen(3000, (err, address) => {\n  if (err) throw err\n  fastify.log.info(`server listening on ${address}`)\n})\nwith async-await:\nconst fastify = require('fastify')({\n  logger: true\n})\n\nfastify.get('\/', async (request, reply) => {\n  reply.type('application\/json').code(200)\n  return { hello: 'world' }\n})\n\nfastify.listen(3000, (err, address) => {\n  if (err) throw err\n  fastify.log.info(`server listening on ${address}`)\n})\nDo you want to know more? Head to the Getting Started.\nFastify v1.x and v2.x\nCode for Fastify's v1.x is in branch 1.x, so all Fastify 1.x related changes should be based on branch 1.x.\nIn a similar way, all Fastify v2.x related changes should be based on branch 2.x.\n\nNote\n.listen binds to the local host, localhost, interface by default (127.0.0.1 or ::1, depending on the operating system configuration). If you are running Fastify in a container (Docker, GCP, etc.), you may need to bind to 0.0.0.0.

Bug reports and\nPRs welcome!\nLooking for winston@2.x documentation?\nPlease note that the documentation below is for winston@3.\nRead the winston@2.x documentation.\nMotivation\nwinston is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with\nsupport for multiple transports. A transport is essentially a storage device\nfor your logs. Each winston logger can have multiple transports (see:\nTransports) configured at different levels (see: Logging levels). For\nexample, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location\n(like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file.\nwinston aims to decouple parts of the logging process to make it more\nflexible and extensible. Attention is given to supporting flexibility in log\nformatting (see: Formats) & levels (see: Using custom logging levels), and\nensuring those APIs decoupled from the implementation of transport logging\n(i.e. how the logs are stored \/ indexed, see: Adding Custom Transports) to\nthe API that they exposed to the programmer.\nQuick Start\nTL;DR? Check out the quick start example in .\/examples\/.\nThere are a number of other examples in .\/examples\/*.js.\nDon't see an example you think should be there? Submit a pull request\nto add it!\nUsage\nThe recommended way to use winston is to create your own logger. The\nsimplest way to do this is using winston.createLogger:\nconst winston = require('winston');\n\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  level: 'info',\n  format: winston.format.json(),\n  defaultMeta: { service: 'user-service' },\n  transports: [\n    \/\/\n    \/\/ - Write all logs with level `error` and below to `error.log`\n    \/\/ - Write all logs with level `info` and below to `combined.log`\n    \/\/\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }),\n  ],\n});\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ If we're not in production then log to the `console` with the format:\n\/\/ `${info.level}: ${info.message} JSON.stringify({ ...rest }) `\n\/\/\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  logger.add(new winston.transports.Console({\n    format: winston.format.simple(),\n  }));\n}\nYou may also log directly via the default logger exposed by\nrequire('winston'), but this merely intended to be a convenient shared\nlogger to use throughout your application if you so choose.\nTable of contents\n\nMotivation\nQuick Start\nUsage\nTable of Contents\nLogging\n\nCreating your logger\nStreams, objectMode, and info objects\n\n\nFormats\n\nCombining formats\nString interpolation\nFiltering info Objects\nCreating custom formats\n\n\nLogging levels\n\nUsing logging levels\nUsing custom logging levels\n\n\nTransports\n\nMultiple transports of the same type\nAdding Custom Transports\nCommon Transport options\n\n\nExceptions\n\nHandling Uncaught Exceptions with winston\nTo Exit or Not to Exit\n\n\nRejections\n\nHandling Uncaught Promise Rejections with winston\n\n\nProfiling\nStreaming Logs\nQuerying Logs\nFurther Reading\n\nUsing the default logger\nAwaiting logs to be written in winston\nWorking with multiple Loggers in winston\n\n\nInstallation\nRun Tests\n\nLogging\nLogging levels in winston conform to the severity ordering specified by\nRFC5424: severity of all levels is assumed to be numerically ascending\nfrom most important to least important.\nconst levels = { \n  error: 0,\n  warn: 1,\n  info: 2,\n  http: 3,\n  verbose: 4,\n  debug: 5,\n  silly: 6\n};\nCreating your own Logger\nYou get started by creating a logger using winston.createLogger:\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console(),\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' })\n  ]\n});\nA logger accepts\u00a0the following parameters:\n\n\n\nName\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlevel\n'info'\nLog only if info.level less than or equal to this level\n\n\nlevels\nwinston.config.npm.levels\nLevels (and colors) representing log priorities\n\n\nformat\nwinston.format.json\nFormatting for info messages  (see: Formats)\n\n\ntransports\n[] (No transports)\nSet of logging targets for info messages\n\n\nexitOnError\ntrue\nIf false, handled exceptions will not cause process.exit\n\n\nsilent\nfalse\nIf true, all logs are suppressed\n\n\n\nThe levels provided to createLogger will be defined as convenience methods\non the logger returned.\n\/\/\n\/\/ Logging\n\/\/\nlogger.log({\n  level: 'info',\n  message: 'Hello distributed log files!'\n});\n\nlogger.info('Hello again distributed logs');\nYou can add or remove transports from the logger once it has been provided\nto you from winston.createLogger:\nconst files = new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' });\nconst console = new winston.transports.Console();\n\nlogger\n  .clear()          \/\/ Remove all transports\n  .add(console)     \/\/ Add console transport\n  .add(files)       \/\/ Add file transport\n  .remove(console); \/\/ Remove console transport\nYou can also wholesale reconfigure a winston.Logger instance using the\nconfigure method:\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  level: 'info',\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console(),\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' })\n  ]\n});\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Replaces the previous transports with those in the\n\/\/ new configuration wholesale.\n\/\/\nconst DailyRotateFile = require('winston-daily-rotate-file');\nlogger.configure({\n  level: 'verbose',\n  transports: [\n    new DailyRotateFile(opts)\n  ]\n});\nCreating child loggers\nYou can create child loggers from existing loggers to pass metadata overrides:\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console(),\n  ]\n});\n\nconst childLogger = logger.child({ requestId: '451' });\nStreams, objectMode, and info objects\nIn winston, both Logger and Transport instances are treated as\nobjectMode\nstreams that accept an info object.\nThe info parameter provided to a given format represents a single log\nmessage. The object itself is mutable. Every info must have at least the\nlevel and message properties:\nconst info = {\n  level: 'info',                 \/\/ Level of the logging message  \n  message: 'Hey! Log something?' \/\/ Descriptive message being logged.\n};\nProperties besides level and message are considered as \"meta\". i.e.:\nconst { level, message, ...meta } = info;\nSeveral of the formats in logform itself add additional properties:\n\n\n\nProperty\nFormat added by\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsplat\nsplat()\nString interpolation splat for %d %s-style messages.\n\n\ntimestamp\ntimestamp()\ntimestamp the message was received.\n\n\nlabel\nlabel()\nCustom label associated with each message.\n\n\nms\nms()\nNumber of milliseconds since the previous log message.\n\n\n\nAs a consumer you may add whatever properties you wish \u2013\u00a0internal state is\nmaintained by Symbol properties:\n\nSymbol.for('level') (READ-ONLY): equal to level property.\nIs treated as immutable by all code.\nSymbol.for('message'): complete string message set by \"finalizing formats\":\n\njson\nlogstash\nprintf\nprettyPrint\nsimple\n\n\nSymbol.for('splat'): additional string interpolation arguments. Used\nexclusively by splat() format.\n\nThese Symbols are stored in another package: triple-beam so that all\nconsumers of logform can have the same Symbol reference. i.e.:\nconst { LEVEL, MESSAGE, SPLAT } = require('triple-beam');\n\nconsole.log(LEVEL === Symbol.for('level'));\n\/\/ true\n\nconsole.log(MESSAGE === Symbol.for('message'));\n\/\/ true\n\nconsole.log(SPLAT === Symbol.for('splat'));\n\/\/ true\n\nNOTE: any { message\u00a0} property in a meta object provided will\nautomatically be concatenated to any msg already provided: For\nexample the below will concatenate 'world' onto 'hello':\nlogger.log('error', 'hello', { message: 'world' });\nlogger.info('hello', { message: 'world' });\n\nFormats\nFormats in winston can be accessed from winston.format. They are\nimplemented in logform, a separate\nmodule from winston. This allows flexibility when writing your own transports\nin case you wish to include a default format with your transport.\nIn modern versions of node template strings are very performant and are the\nrecommended way for doing most end-user formatting. If you want to bespoke\nformat your logs, winston.format.printf is for you:\nconst { createLogger, format, transports } = require('winston');\nconst { combine, timestamp, label, printf } = format;\n\nconst myFormat = printf(({ level, message, label, timestamp }) => {\n  return `${timestamp} [${label}] ${level}: ${message}`;\n});\n\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  format: combine(\n    label({ label: 'right meow!' }),\n    timestamp(),\n    myFormat\n  ),\n  transports: [new transports.Console()]\n});\nTo see what built-in formats are available and learn more about creating your\nown custom logging formats, see logform.\nCombining formats\nAny number of formats may be combined into a single format using\nformat.combine. Since format.combine takes no opts, as a convenience it\nreturns pre-created instance of the combined format.\nconst { createLogger, format, transports } = require('winston');\nconst { combine, timestamp, label, prettyPrint } = format;\n\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  format: combine(\n    label({ label: 'right meow!' }),\n    timestamp(),\n    prettyPrint()\n  ),\n  transports: [new transports.Console()]\n})\n\nlogger.log({\n  level: 'info',\n  message: 'What time is the testing at?'\n});\n\/\/ Outputs:\n\/\/ { level: 'info',\n\/\/   message: 'What time is the testing at?',\n\/\/   label: 'right meow!',\n\/\/   timestamp: '2017-09-30T03:57:26.875Z' }\nString interpolation\nThe log method provides the string interpolation using util.format. It\nmust be enabled using format.splat().\nBelow is an example that defines a format with string interpolation of\nmessages using format.splat and then serializes the entire info message\nusing format.simple.\nconst { createLogger, format, transports } = require('winston');\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  format: format.combine(\n    format.splat(),\n    format.simple()\n  ),\n  transports: [new transports.Console()]\n});\n\n\/\/\u00a0info: test message my string {}\nlogger.log('info', 'test message %s', 'my string');\n\n\/\/\u00a0info: test message 123 {}\nlogger.log('info', 'test message %d', 123);\n\n\/\/ info: test message first second {number: 123}\nlogger.log('info', 'test message %s, %s', 'first', 'second', { number: 123 });\nFiltering info Objects\nIf you wish to filter out a given info Object completely when logging then\nsimply return a falsey value.\nconst { createLogger, format, transports } = require('winston');\n\n\/\/ Ignore log messages if they have { private: true }\nconst ignorePrivate = format((info, opts) => {\n  if (info.private) { return false; }\n  return info;\n});\n\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  format: format.combine(\n    ignorePrivate(),\n    format.json()\n  ),\n  transports: [new transports.Console()]\n});\n\n\/\/ Outputs: {\"level\":\"error\",\"message\":\"Public error to share\"}\nlogger.log({\n  level: 'error',\n  message: 'Public error to share'\n});\n\n\/\/ Messages with { private: true } will not be written when logged.\nlogger.log({\n  private: true,\n  level: 'error',\n  message: 'This is super secret - hide it.'\n});\nUse of format.combine will respect any falsey values return and stop\nevaluation of later formats in the series. For example:\nconst { format } = require('winston');\nconst { combine, timestamp, label } = format;\n\nconst willNeverThrow = format.combine(\n  format(info => { return false })(), \/\/ Ignores everything\n  format(info => { throw new Error('Never reached') })()\n);\nCreating custom formats\nFormats are prototypal objects (i.e. class instances) that define a single\nmethod: transform(info, opts) and return the mutated info:\n\ninfo: an object representing the log message.\nopts: setting specific to the current instance of the format.\n\nThey are expected to return one of two things:\n\nAn info Object representing the modified info argument. Object\nreferences need not be preserved\u00a0if immutability is preferred. All current\nbuilt-in formats consider info mutable, but [immutablejs] is being\nconsidered for future releases.\nA falsey value indicating that the info argument should be ignored by the\ncaller. (See: Filtering info Objects) below.\n\nwinston.format is designed to be as simple as possible. To define a new\nformat simple pass it a transform(info, opts) function to get a new\nFormat.\nThe named Format returned can be used to create as many copies of the given\nFormat as desired:\nconst { format } = require('winston');\n\nconst volume = format((info, opts) => {\n  if (opts.yell) {\n    info.message = info.message.toUpperCase();\n  } else if (opts.whisper) {\n    info.message = info.message.toLowerCase();\n  }\n\n  return info;\n});\n\n\/\/ `volume` is now a function that returns instances of the format.\nconst scream = volume({ yell: true });\nconsole.dir(scream.transform({\n  level: 'info',\n  message: `sorry for making you YELL in your head!`\n}, scream.options));\n\/\/ {\n\/\/   level: 'info'\n\/\/   message: 'SORRY FOR MAKING YOU YELL IN YOUR HEAD!'\n\/\/ }\n\n\/\/ `volume` can be used multiple times to create different formats.\nconst whisper = volume({ whisper: true });\nconsole.dir(whisper.transform({\n  level: 'info',\n  message: `WHY ARE THEY MAKING US YELL SO MUCH!`\n}, whisper.options));\n\/\/ {\n\/\/   level: 'info'\n\/\/   message: 'why are they making us yell so much!'\n\/\/ }\nLogging Levels\nLogging levels in winston conform to the severity ordering specified by\nRFC5424: severity of all levels is assumed to be numerically ascending\nfrom most important to least important.\nEach level is given a specific integer priority. The higher the priority the\nmore important the message is considered to be, and the lower the\ncorresponding integer priority.  For example, as specified exactly in RFC5424\nthe syslog levels are prioritized from 0 to 7 (highest to lowest).\n{ \n  emerg: 0, \n  alert: 1, \n  crit: 2, \n  error: 3, \n  warning: 4, \n  notice: 5, \n  info: 6, \n  debug: 7\n}\nSimilarly, npm logging levels are prioritized from 0 to 6 (highest to\nlowest):\n{ \n  error: 0, \n  warn: 1, \n  info: 2, \n  http: 3,\n  verbose: 4, \n  debug: 5, \n  silly: 6 \n}\nIf you do not explicitly define the levels that winston should use, the\nnpm levels above will be used.\nUsing Logging Levels\nSetting the level for your logging message can be accomplished in one of two\nways. You can pass a string representing the logging level to the log() method\nor use the level specified methods defined on every winston Logger.\n\/\/\n\/\/ Any logger instance\n\/\/\nlogger.log('silly', \"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.log('debug', \"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.log('verbose', \"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.log('info', \"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.log('warn', \"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.log('error', \"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.info(\"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.warn(\"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nlogger.error(\"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Default logger\n\/\/\nwinston.log('info', \"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nwinston.info(\"127.0.0.1 - there's no place like home\");\nwinston allows you to define a level property on each transport which\nspecifies the maximum level of messages that a transport should log. For\nexample, using the syslog levels you could log only error messages to the\nconsole and everything info and below to a file (which includes error\nmessages):\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  levels: winston.config.syslog.levels,\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console({ level: 'error' }),\n    new winston.transports.File({\n      filename: 'combined.log',\n      level: 'info'\n    })\n  ]\n});\nYou may also dynamically change the log level of a transport:\nconst transports = {\n  console: new winston.transports.Console({ level: 'warn' }),\n  file: new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log', level: 'error' })\n};\n\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    transports.console,\n    transports.file\n  ]\n});\n\nlogger.info('Will not be logged in either transport!');\ntransports.console.level = 'info';\ntransports.file.level = 'info';\nlogger.info('Will be logged in both transports!');\nwinston supports customizable logging levels, defaulting to npm style\nlogging levels. Levels must be specified at the time of creating your logger.\nUsing Custom Logging Levels\nIn addition to the predefined npm, syslog, and cli levels available in\nwinston, you can also choose to define your own:\nconst myCustomLevels = {\n  levels: {\n    foo: 0,\n    bar: 1,\n    baz: 2,\n    foobar: 3\n  },\n  colors: {\n    foo: 'blue',\n    bar: 'green',\n    baz: 'yellow',\n    foobar: 'red'\n  }\n};\n\nconst customLevelLogger = winston.createLogger({\n  levels: myCustomLevels.levels\n});\n\ncustomLevelLogger.foobar('some foobar level-ed message');\nAlthough there is slight repetition in this data structure, it enables simple\nencapsulation if you do not want to have colors. If you do wish to have\ncolors, in addition to passing the levels to the Logger itself, you must make\nwinston aware of them:\nwinston.addColors(myCustomLevels.colors);\nThis enables loggers using the colorize formatter to appropriately color and style\nthe output of custom levels.\nAdditionally, you can also change background color and font style.\nFor example,\nbaz: 'italic yellow',\nfoobar: 'bold red cyanBG'\nPossible options are below.\n\n\nFont styles: bold, dim, italic, underline, inverse, hidden,\nstrikethrough.\n\n\nFont foreground colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,\ncyan, white, gray, grey.\n\n\nBackground colors: blackBG, redBG, greenBG, yellowBG, blueBG\nmagentaBG, cyanBG, whiteBG\n\n\nColorizing Standard logging levels\nTo colorize the standard logging level add\nwinston.format.combine(\n  winston.format.colorize(),\n  winston.format.json()\n);\nwhere winston.format.json() is whatever other formatter you want to use.  The colorize formatter must come before any formatters adding text you wish to color.\nTransports\nThere are several core transports included in  winston, which leverage the\nbuilt-in networking and file I\/O offered by Node.js core. In addition, there\nare additional transports written by members of the community.\nMultiple transports of the same type\nIt is possible to use multiple transports of the same type e.g.\nwinston.transports.File when you construct the transport.\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.File({\n      filename: 'combined.log',\n      level: 'info'\n    }),\n    new winston.transports.File({\n      filename: 'errors.log',\n      level: 'error'\n    })\n  ]\n});\nIf you later want to remove one of these transports you can do so by using the\ntransport itself. e.g.:\nconst combinedLogs = logger.transports.find(transport => {\n  return transport.filename === 'combined.log'\n});\n\nlogger.remove(combinedLogs);\nAdding Custom Transports\nAdding a custom transport is easy. All you need to do is accept any options\nyou need, implement a log() method, and consume it with winston.\nconst Transport = require('winston-transport');\nconst util = require('util');\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Inherit from `winston-transport` so you can take advantage\n\/\/ of the base functionality and `.exceptions.handle()`.\n\/\/\nmodule.exports = class YourCustomTransport extends Transport {\n  constructor(opts) {\n    super(opts);\n    \/\/\n    \/\/ Consume any custom options here. e.g.:\n    \/\/ - Connection information for databases\n    \/\/ - Authentication information for APIs (e.g. loggly, papertrail, \n    \/\/   logentries, etc.).\n    \/\/\n  }\n\n  log(info, callback) {\n    setImmediate(() => {\n      this.emit('logged', info);\n    });\n\n    \/\/ Perform the writing to the remote service\n    callback();\n  }\n};\nCommon Transport options\nAs every transport inherits from winston-transport, it's possible to set\na custom format and a custom log level on each transport separately:\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.File({\n      filename: 'error.log',\n      level: 'error',\n      format: winston.format.json()\n    }),\n    new transports.Http({\n      level: 'warn',\n      format: winston.format.json()\n    }),\n    new transports.Console({\n      level: 'info',\n      format: winston.format.combine(\n        winston.format.colorize(),\n        winston.format.simple()\n      )\n    })\n  ]\n});\nExceptions\nHandling Uncaught Exceptions with winston\nWith winston, it is possible to catch and log uncaughtException events\nfrom your process. With your own logger instance you can enable this behavior\nwhen it's created or later on in your applications lifecycle:\nconst { createLogger, transports } = require('winston');\n\n\/\/ Enable exception handling when you create your logger.\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }) \n  ],\n  exceptionHandlers: [\n    new transports.File({ filename: 'exceptions.log' })\n  ]\n});\n\n\/\/ Or enable it later on by adding a transport or using `.exceptions.handle`\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }) \n  ]\n});\n\n\/\/ Call exceptions.handle with a transport to handle exceptions\nlogger.exceptions.handle(\n  new transports.File({ filename: 'exceptions.log' })\n);\nIf you want to use this feature with the default logger, simply call\n.exceptions.handle() with a transport instance.\n\/\/\n\/\/ You can add a separate exception logger by passing it to `.exceptions.handle`\n\/\/\nwinston.exceptions.handle(\n  new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'path\/to\/exceptions.log' })\n);\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Alternatively you can set `handleExceptions` to true when adding transports\n\/\/ to winston.\n\/\/\nwinston.add(new winston.transports.File({\n  filename: 'path\/to\/combined.log',\n  handleExceptions: true\n}));\nTo Exit or Not to Exit\nBy default, winston will exit after logging an uncaughtException. If this is\nnot the behavior you want, set exitOnError = false\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({ exitOnError: false });\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ or, like this:\n\/\/\nlogger.exitOnError = false;\nWhen working with custom logger instances, you can pass in separate transports\nto the exceptionHandlers property or set handleExceptions on any\ntransport.\nExample 1\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'path\/to\/combined.log' })\n  ],\n  exceptionHandlers: [\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'path\/to\/exceptions.log' })\n  ]\n});\nExample 2\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console({\n      handleExceptions: true\n    })\n  ],\n  exitOnError: false\n});\nThe exitOnError option can also be a function to prevent exit on only\ncertain types of errors:\nfunction ignoreEpipe(err) {\n  return err.code !== 'EPIPE';\n}\n\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({ exitOnError: ignoreEpipe });\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ or, like this:\n\/\/\nlogger.exitOnError = ignoreEpipe;\nRejections\nHandling Uncaught Promise Rejections with winston\nWith winston, it is possible to catch and log uncaughtRejection events\nfrom your process. With your own logger instance you can enable this behavior\nwhen it's created or later on in your applications lifecycle:\nconst { createLogger, transports } = require('winston');\n\n\/\/ Enable rejection handling when you create your logger.\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }) \n  ],\n  rejectionHandlers: [\n    new transports.File({ filename: 'rejections.log' })\n  ]\n});\n\n\/\/ Or enable it later on by adding a transport or using `.rejections.handle`\nconst logger = createLogger({\n  transports: [\n    new transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }) \n  ]\n});\n\n\/\/ Call rejections.handle with a transport to handle rejections\nlogger.rejections.handle(\n  new transports.File({ filename: 'rejections.log' })\n);\nIf you want to use this feature with the default logger, simply call\n.rejections.handle() with a transport instance.\n\/\/\n\/\/ You can add a separate rejection logger by passing it to `.rejections.handle`\n\/\/\nwinston.rejections.handle(\n  new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'path\/to\/rejections.log' })\n);\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Alternatively you can set `handleRejections` to true when adding transports\n\/\/ to winston.\n\/\/\nwinston.add(new winston.transports.File({\n  filename: 'path\/to\/combined.log',\n  handleRejections: true\n}));\nProfiling\nIn addition to logging messages and metadata, winston also has a simple\nprofiling mechanism implemented for any logger:\n\/\/\n\/\/ Start profile of 'test'\n\/\/\nlogger.profile('test');\n\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  \/\/\n  \/\/ Stop profile of 'test'. Logging will now take place:\n  \/\/   '17 Jan 21:00:00 - info: test duration=1000ms'\n  \/\/\n  logger.profile('test');\n}, 1000);\nAlso you can start a timer and keep a reference that you can call `.done()``\non:\n \/\/ Returns an object corresponding to a specific timing. When done\n \/\/ is called the timer will finish and log the duration. e.g.:\n \/\/\n const profiler = logger.startTimer();\n setTimeout(function () {\n   profiler.done({ message: 'Logging message' });\n }, 1000);\nAll profile messages are set to 'info' level by default, and both message and\nmetadata are optional.  For individual profile messages, you can override the default log level by supplying a metadata object with a level property:\nlogger.profile('test', { level: 'debug' });\nQuerying Logs\nwinston supports querying of logs with Loggly-like options. See Loggly\nSearch API. Specifically:\nFile, Couchdb, Redis, Loggly, Nssocket, and Http.\nconst options = {\n  from: new Date() - (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),\n  until: new Date(),\n  limit: 10,\n  start: 0,\n  order: 'desc',\n  fields: ['message']\n};\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Find items logged between today and yesterday.\n\/\/\nlogger.query(options, function (err, results) {\n  if (err) {\n    \/* TODO: handle me *\/\n    throw err;\n  }\n\n  console.log(results);\n});\nStreaming Logs\nStreaming allows you to stream your logs back from your chosen transport.\n\/\/\n\/\/ Start at the end.\n\/\/\nwinston.stream({ start: -1 }).on('log', function(log) {\n  console.log(log);\n});\nFurther Reading\nUsing the Default Logger\nThe default logger is accessible through the winston module directly. Any\nmethod that you could call on an instance of a logger is available on the\ndefault logger:\nconst winston = require('winston');\n\nwinston.log('info', 'Hello distributed log files!');\nwinston.info('Hello again distributed logs');\n\nwinston.level = 'debug';\nwinston.log('debug', 'Now my debug messages are written to console!');\nBy default, no transports are set on the default logger. You must\nadd or remove transports via the add() and remove() methods:\nconst files = new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' });\nconst console = new winston.transports.Console();\n\nwinston.add(console);\nwinston.add(files);\nwinston.remove(console);\nOr do it with one call to configure():\nwinston.configure({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'somefile.log' })\n  ]\n});\nFor more documentation about working with each individual transport supported\nby winston see the winston Transports document.\nAwaiting logs to be written in winston\nOften it is useful to wait for your logs to be written before exiting the\nprocess. Each instance of winston.Logger is also a [Node.js stream]. A\nfinish event will be raised when all logs have flushed to all transports\nafter the stream has been ended.\nconst transport = new winston.transports.Console();\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  transports: [transport]\n});\n\nlogger.on('finish', function (info) {\n  \/\/ All `info` log messages has now been logged\n});\n\nlogger.info('CHILL WINSTON!', { seriously: true });\nlogger.end();\nIt is also worth mentioning that the logger also emits an 'error' event which\nyou should handle or suppress if you don't want unhandled exceptions:\n\/\/\n\/\/ Handle errors\n\/\/\nlogger.on('error', function (err) { \/* Do Something *\/ });\nWorking with multiple Loggers in winston\nOften in larger, more complex, applications it is necessary to have multiple\nlogger instances with different settings. Each logger is responsible for a\ndifferent feature area (or category). This is exposed in winston in two\nways: through winston.loggers and instances of winston.Container. In fact,\nwinston.loggers is just a predefined instance of winston.Container:\nconst winston = require('winston');\nconst { format } = winston;\nconst { combine, label, json } = format;\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Configure the logger for `category1`\n\/\/\nwinston.loggers.add('category1', {\n  format: combine(\n    label({ label: 'category one' }),\n    json()\n  ),\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console({ level: 'silly' }),\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'somefile.log' })\n  ]\n});\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Configure the logger for `category2`\n\/\/\nwinston.loggers.add('category2', {\n  format: combine(\n    label({ label: 'category two' }),\n    json()\n  ),\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Http({ host: 'localhost', port:8080 })\n  ]\n});\nNow that your loggers are setup, you can require winston in any file in your\napplication and access these pre-configured loggers:\nconst winston = require('winston');\n\n\/\/\n\/\/ Grab your preconfigured loggers\n\/\/\nconst category1 = winston.loggers.get('category1');\nconst category2 = winston.loggers.get('category2');\n\ncategory1.info('logging to file and console transports');\ncategory2.info('logging to http transport');\nIf you prefer to manage the Container yourself, you can simply instantiate one:\nconst winston = require('winston');\nconst { format } = winston;\nconst { combine, label, json } = format;\n\nconst container = new winston.Container();\n\ncontainer.add('category1', {\n  format: combine(\n    label({ label: 'category one' }),\n    json()\n  ),\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console({ level: 'silly' }),\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'somefile.log' })\n  ]\n});\n\nconst category1 = container.get('category1');\ncategory1.info('logging to file and console transports');\nInstallation\nnpm install winston\nyarn add winston\nRun Tests\nAll of the winston tests are written with mocha, nyc, and\nassume.  They can be run with npm.\nnpm test\nAuthor: Charlie Robbins\nContributors: Jarrett Cruger, David Hyde, Chris Alderson\n","120":"English \u2219 \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e \u2219 \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 \u2219 \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 | \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u200e \u2219 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be \u2219 Portugu\u00eas do Brasil \u2219 Deutsch \u2219 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u2219 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u2219 Italiano \u2219 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \u2219 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u2219 Polski \u2219 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u2219 Espa\u00f1ol \u2219 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u2219 T\u00fcrk\u00e7e \u2219 ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t \u2219 Fran\u00e7ais | Add Translation\nHelp translate this guide!\nThe System Design Primer\n\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\nLearn how to design large-scale systems.\nPrep for the system design interview.\n\nLearn how to design large-scale systems\nLearning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.\nSystem design is a broad topic.

You are expected to lead it.\nYou can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the System design interview questions with solutions section using the following steps.\nStep 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions\nGather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.\n\nWho is going to use it?\nHow are they going to use it?\nHow many users are there?\nWhat does the system do?\nWhat are the inputs and outputs of the system?\nHow much data do we expect to handle?\nHow many requests per second do we expect?\nWhat is the expected read to write ratio?\n\nStep 2: Create a high level design\nOutline a high level design with all important components.\n\nSketch the main components and connections\nJustify your ideas\n\nStep 3: Design core components\nDive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to design a url shortening service, discuss:\n\nGenerating and storing a hash of the full url\n\nMD5 and Base62\nHash collisions\nSQL or NoSQL\nDatabase schema\n\n\nTranslating a hashed url to the full url\n\nDatabase lookup\n\n\nAPI and object-oriented design\n\nStep 4: Scale the design\nIdentify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?\n\nLoad balancer\nHorizontal scaling\nCaching\nDatabase sharding\n\nDiscuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using principles of scalable system design.\nBack-of-the-envelope calculations\nYou might be asked to do some estimates by hand.

Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.1\nAnother way to look at performance vs scalability:\n\nIf you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.\nIf you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nA word on scalability\nScalability, availability, stability, patterns\n\nLatency vs throughput\nLatency is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.\nThroughput is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.\nGenerally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nUnderstanding latency vs throughput\n\nAvailability vs consistency\nCAP theorem\n\n\n\nSource: CAP theorem revisited\n\nIn a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:\n\nConsistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error\nAvailability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information\nPartition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures\n\nNetworks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.\nCP - consistency and partition tolerance\nWaiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.\nAP - availability and partition tolerance\nResponses return the most readily available version of the data available on any node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.\nAP is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nCAP theorem revisited\nA plain english introduction to CAP theorem\nCAP FAQ\nThe CAP theorem\n\nConsistency patterns\nWith multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data.  Recall the definition of consistency from the CAP theorem - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\nWeak consistency\nAfter a write, reads may or may not see it.  A best effort approach is taken.\nThis approach is seen in systems such as memcached.  Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games.  For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.\nEventual consistency\nAfter a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds).  Data is replicated asynchronously.\nThis approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email.  Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.\nStrong consistency\nAfter a write, reads will see it.  Data is replicated synchronously.\nThis approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes.  Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nTransactions across data centers\n\nAvailability patterns\nThere are two complementary patterns to support high availability: fail-over and replication.\nFail-over\nActive-passive\nWith active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.  If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.\nThe length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby.  Only the active server handles traffic.\nActive-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.\nActive-active\nIn active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.\nIf the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.  If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.\nActive-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.\nDisadvantage(s): failover\n\nFail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.\nThere is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.\n\nReplication\nMaster-slave and master-master\nThis topic is further discussed in the Database section:\n\nMaster-slave replication\nMaster-master replication\n\nAvailability in numbers\nAvailability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available.  Availability is generally measured in number of 9s--a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.\n99.9% availability - three 9s\n\n\n\nDuration\nAcceptable downtime\n\n\n\n\nDowntime per year\n8h 45min 57s\n\n\nDowntime per month\n43m 49.7s\n\n\nDowntime per week\n10m 4.8s\n\n\nDowntime per day\n1m 26.4s\n\n\n\n99.99% availability - four 9s\n\n\n\nDuration\nAcceptable downtime\n\n\n\n\nDowntime per year\n52min 35.7s\n\n\nDowntime per month\n4m 23s\n\n\nDowntime per week\n1m 5s\n\n\nDowntime per day\n8.6s\n\n\n\nAvailability in parallel vs in sequence\nIf a service consists of multiple components prone to failure, the service's overall availability depends on whether the components are in sequence or in parallel.\nIn sequence\nOverall availability decreases when two components with availability < 100% are in sequence:\nAvailability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)\n\nIf both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in sequence would be 99.8%.\nIn parallel\nOverall availability increases when two components with availability < 100% are in parallel:\nAvailability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))\n\nIf both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in parallel would be 99.9999%.\nDomain name system\n\n\n\nSource: DNS security presentation\n\nA Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.\nDNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level.  Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup.  Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays.  DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL).\n\nNS record (name server) - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain\/subdomain.\nMX record (mail exchange) - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.\nA record (address) - Points a name to an IP address.\nCNAME (canonical) - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to www.example.com) or to an A record.\n\nServices such as CloudFlare and Route 53 provide managed DNS services.  Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:\n\nWeighted round robin\n\nPrevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance\nBalance between varying cluster sizes\nA\/B testing\n\n\nLatency-based\nGeolocation-based\n\nDisadvantage(s): DNS\n\nAccessing a DNS server introduces a slight delay, although mitigated by caching described above.\nDNS server management could be complex and is generally managed by governments, ISPs, and large companies.\nDNS services have recently come under DDoS attack, preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter's IP address(es).\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nDNS architecture\nWikipedia\nDNS articles\n\nContent delivery network\n\n\n\nSource: Why use a CDN\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.  Generally, static files such as HTML\/CSS\/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content.  The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.\nServing content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:\n\nUsers receive content from data centers close to them\nYour servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills\n\nPush CDNs\nPush CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.  You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.  You can configure when content expires and when it is updated.  Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.\nSites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs.  Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.\nPull CDNs\nPull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content.  You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN.  This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.\nA time-to-live (TTL) determines how long content is cached.  Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.\nSites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.\nDisadvantage(s): CDN\n\nCDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.\nContent might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.\nCDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nGlobally distributed content delivery\nThe differences between push and pull CDNs\nWikipedia\n\nLoad balancer\n\n\n\nSource: Scalable system design patterns\n\nLoad balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases.  In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client.  Load balancers are effective at:\n\nPreventing requests from going to unhealthy servers\nPreventing overloading resources\nHelping to eliminate a single point of failure\n\nLoad balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.\nAdditional benefits include:\n\nSSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations\n\nRemoves the need to install X.509 certificates on each server\n\n\nSession persistence - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions\n\nTo protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in active-passive or active-active mode.\nLoad balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:\n\nRandom\nLeast loaded\nSession\/cookies\nRound robin or weighted round robin\nLayer 4\nLayer 7\n\nLayer 4 load balancing\nLayer 4 load balancers look at info at the transport layer to decide how to distribute requests.  Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.  Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing Network Address Translation (NAT).\nLayer 7 load balancing\nLayer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests.  This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies.  Layer 7 load balancers terminate network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.  For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.\nAt the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.\nHorizontal scaling\nLoad balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability.  Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called Vertical Scaling.  It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.\nDisadvantage(s): horizontal scaling\n\nScaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers\n\nServers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures\nSessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent cache (Redis, Memcached)\n\n\nDownstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out\n\nDisadvantage(s): load balancer\n\nThe load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.\nIntroducing a load balancer to help eliminate a single point of failure results in increased complexity.\nA single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nNGINX architecture\nHAProxy architecture guide\nScalability\nWikipedia\nLayer 4 load balancing\nLayer 7 load balancing\nELB listener config\n\nReverse proxy (web server)\n\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nA reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.\nAdditional benefits include:\n\nIncreased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client\nIncreased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration\nSSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations\n\nRemoves the need to install X.509 certificates on each server\n\n\nCompression - Compress server responses\nCaching - Return the response for cached requests\nStatic content - Serve static content directly\n\nHTML\/CSS\/JS\nPhotos\nVideos\nEtc\n\n\n\nLoad balancer vs reverse proxy\n\nDeploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.\nReverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.\nSolutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.\n\nDisadvantage(s): reverse proxy\n\nIntroducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.\nA single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a failover) further increases complexity.\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nReverse proxy vs load balancer\nNGINX architecture\nHAProxy architecture guide\nWikipedia\n\nApplication layer\n\n\n\nSource: Intro to architecting systems for scale\n\nSeparating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently.  Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers.  The single responsibility principle advocates for small and autonomous services that work together.  Small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth.\nWorkers in the application layer also help enable asynchronism.\nMicroservices\nRelated to this discussion are microservices, which can be described as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services.  Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. 1\nPinterest, for example, could have the following microservices: user profile, follower, feed, search, photo upload, etc.\nService Discovery\nSystems such as Consul, Etcd, and Zookeeper can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names, addresses, and ports.  Health checks help verify service integrity and are often done using an HTTP endpoint.  Both Consul and Etcd have a built in key-value store that can be useful for storing config values and other shared data.\nDisadvantage(s): application layer\n\nAdding an application layer with loosely coupled services requires a different approach from an architectural, operations, and process viewpoint (vs a monolithic system).\nMicroservices can add complexity in terms of deployments and operations.\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nIntro to architecting systems for scale\nCrack the system design interview\nService oriented architecture\nIntroduction to Zookeeper\nHere's what you need to know about building microservices\n\nDatabase\n\n\n\nSource: Scaling up to your first 10 million users\n\nRelational database management system (RDBMS)\nA relational database like SQL is a collection of data items organized in tables.\nACID is a set of properties of relational database transactions.\n\nAtomicity - Each transaction is all or nothing\nConsistency - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another\nIsolation - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially\nDurability - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so\n\nThere are many techniques to scale a relational database: master-slave replication, master-master replication, federation, sharding, denormalization, and SQL tuning.\nMaster-slave replication\nThe master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves, which serve only reads.  Slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion.  If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.\n\n\n\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\n\nDisadvantage(s): master-slave replication\n\nAdditional logic is needed to promote a slave to a master.\nSee Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.\n\nMaster-master replication\nBoth masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on writes.  If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.\n\n\n\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\n\nDisadvantage(s): master-master replication\n\nYou'll need a load balancer or you'll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write.\nMost master-master systems are either loosely consistent (violating ACID) or have increased write latency due to synchronization.\nConflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.\nSee Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.\n\nDisadvantage(s): replication\n\nThere is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.\nWrites are replayed to the read replicas.  If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.\nThe more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.\nOn some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.\nReplication adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n\nSource(s) and further reading: replication\n\nScalability, availability, stability, patterns\nMulti-master replication\n\nFederation\n\n\n\nSource: Scaling up to your first 10 million users\n\nFederation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function.  For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: forums, users, and products, resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag.  Smaller databases result in more data that can fit in memory, which in turn results in more cache hits due to improved cache locality.  With no single central master serializing writes you can write in parallel, increasing throughput.\nDisadvantage(s): federation\n\nFederation is not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables.\nYou'll need to update your application logic to determine which database to read and write.\nJoining data from two databases is more complex with a server link.\nFederation adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n\nSource(s) and further reading: federation\n\nScaling up to your first 10 million users\n\nSharding\n\n\n\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\n\nSharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data.  Taking a users database as an example, as the number of users increases, more shards are added to the cluster.\nSimilar to the advantages of federation, sharding results in less read and write traffic, less replication, and more cache hits.  Index size is also reduced, which generally improves performance with faster queries.  If one shard goes down, the other shards are still operational, although you'll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss.  Like federation, there is no single central master serializing writes, allowing you to write in parallel with increased throughput.\nCommon ways to shard a table of users is either through the user's last name initial or the user's geographic location.\nDisadvantage(s): sharding\n\nYou'll need to update your application logic to work with shards, which could result in complex SQL queries.\nData distribution can become lopsided in a shard.  For example, a set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others.\n\nRebalancing adds additional complexity.  A sharding function based on consistent hashing can reduce the amount of transferred data.\n\n\nJoining data from multiple shards is more complex.\nSharding adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n\nSource(s) and further reading: sharding\n\nThe coming of the shard\nShard database architecture\nConsistent hashing\n\nDenormalization\nDenormalization attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance.  Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.  Some RDBMS such as PostgreSQL and Oracle support materialized views which handle the work of storing redundant information and keeping redundant copies consistent.\nOnce data becomes distributed with techniques such as federation and sharding, managing joins across data centers further increases complexity.  Denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins.\nIn most systems, reads can heavily outnumber writes 100:1 or even 1000:1.  A read resulting in a complex database join can be very expensive, spending a significant amount of time on disk operations.\nDisadvantage(s): denormalization\n\nData is duplicated.\nConstraints can help redundant copies of information stay in sync, which increases complexity of the database design.\nA denormalized database under heavy write load might perform worse than its normalized counterpart.\n\nSource(s) and further reading: denormalization\n\nDenormalization\n\nSQL tuning\nSQL tuning is a broad topic and many books have been written as reference.\nIt's important to benchmark and profile to simulate and uncover bottlenecks.\n\nBenchmark - Simulate high-load situations with tools such as ab.\nProfile - Enable tools such as the slow query log to help track performance issues.\n\nBenchmarking and profiling might point you to the following optimizations.\nTighten up the schema\n\nMySQL dumps to disk in contiguous blocks for fast access.\nUse CHAR instead of VARCHAR for fixed-length fields.\n\nCHAR effectively allows for fast, random access, whereas with VARCHAR, you must find the end of a string before moving onto the next one.\n\n\nUse TEXT for large blocks of text such as blog posts.  TEXT also allows for boolean searches.  Using a TEXT field results in storing a pointer on disk that is used to locate the text block.\nUse INT for larger numbers up to 2^32 or 4 billion.\nUse DECIMAL for currency to avoid floating point representation errors.\nAvoid storing large BLOBS, store the location of where to get the object instead.\nVARCHAR(255) is the largest number of characters that can be counted in an 8 bit number, often maximizing the use of a byte in some RDBMS.\nSet the NOT NULL constraint where applicable to improve search performance.\n\nUse good indices\n\nColumns that you are querying (SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN) could be faster with indices.\nIndices are usually represented as self-balancing B-tree that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.\nPlacing an index can keep the data in memory, requiring more space.\nWrites could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated.\nWhen loading large amounts of data, it might be faster to disable indices, load the data, then rebuild the indices.\n\nAvoid expensive joins\n\nDenormalize where performance demands it.\n\nPartition tables\n\nBreak up a table by putting hot spots in a separate table to help keep it in memory.\n\nTune the query cache\n\nIn some cases, the query cache could lead to performance issues.\n\nSource(s) and further reading: SQL tuning\n\nTips for optimizing MySQL queries\nIs there a good reason i see VARCHAR(255) used so often?\nHow do null values affect performance?\nSlow query log\n\nNoSQL\nNoSQL is a collection of data items represented in a key-value store, document store, wide column store, or a graph database.  Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code.  Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor eventual consistency.\nBASE is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases.  In comparison with the CAP Theorem, BASE chooses availability over consistency.\n\nBasically available - the system guarantees availability.\nSoft state - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.\nEventual consistency - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that period.\n\nIn addition to choosing between SQL or NoSQL, it is helpful to understand which type of NoSQL database best fits your use case(s).  We'll review key-value stores, document stores, wide column stores, and graph databases in the next section.\nKey-value store\n\nAbstraction: hash table\n\nA key-value store generally allows for O(1) reads and writes and is often backed by memory or SSD.  Data stores can maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges.  Key-value stores can allow for storing of metadata with a value.\nKey-value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly-changing data, such as an in-memory cache layer.  Since they offer only a limited set of operations, complexity is shifted to the application layer if additional operations are needed.\nA key-value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database.\nSource(s) and further reading: key-value store\n\nKey-value database\nDisadvantages of key-value stores\nRedis architecture\nMemcached architecture\n\nDocument store\n\nAbstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values\n\nA document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc), where a document stores all information for a given object.  Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself.  Note, many key-value stores include features for working with a value's metadata, blurring the lines between these two storage types.\nBased on the underlying implementation, documents are organized by collections, tags, metadata, or directories.  Although documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other.\nSome document stores like MongoDB and CouchDB also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries.  DynamoDB supports both key-values and documents.\nDocument stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occasionally changing data.\nSource(s) and further reading: document store\n\nDocument-oriented database\nMongoDB architecture\nCouchDB architecture\nElasticsearch architecture\n\nWide column store\n\n\n\nSource: SQL & NoSQL, a brief history\n\n\nAbstraction: nested map ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>\n\nA wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name\/value pair).  A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table).  Super column families further group column families.  You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row.  Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.\nGoogle introduced Bigtable as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source HBase often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and Cassandra from Facebook.  Stores such as BigTable, HBase, and Cassandra maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of selective key ranges.\nWide column stores offer high availability and high scalability.  They are often used for very large data sets.\nSource(s) and further reading: wide column store\n\nSQL & NoSQL, a brief history\nBigtable architecture\nHBase architecture\nCassandra architecture\n\nGraph database\n\n\n\nSource: Graph database\n\n\nAbstraction: graph\n\nIn a graph database, each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes.  Graph databases are optimized to represent complex relationships with many foreign keys or many-to-many relationships.\nGraphs databases offer high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network.  They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources.

In this model, the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution.\nDatabases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions.  Popular items can skew the distribution, causing bottlenecks.  Putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic.\nClient caching\nCaches can be located on the client side (OS or browser), server side, or in a distinct cache layer.\nCDN caching\nCDNs are considered a type of cache.\nWeb server caching\nReverse proxies and caches such as Varnish can serve static and dynamic content directly.  Web servers can also cache requests, returning responses without having to contact application servers.\nDatabase caching\nYour database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration, optimized for a generic use case.  Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance.\nApplication caching\nIn-memory caches such as Memcached and Redis are key-value stores between your application and your data storage.  Since the data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk.  RAM is more limited than disk, so cache invalidation algorithms such as least recently used (LRU) can help invalidate 'cold' entries and keep 'hot' data in RAM.\nRedis has the following additional features:\n\nPersistence option\nBuilt-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists\n\nThere are multiple levels you can cache that fall into two general categories: database queries and objects:\n\nRow level\nQuery-level\nFully-formed serializable objects\nFully-rendered HTML\n\nGenerally, you should try to avoid file-based caching, as it makes cloning and auto-scaling more difficult.\nCaching at the database query level\nWhenever you query the database, hash the query as a key and store the result to the cache.  This approach suffers from expiration issues:\n\nHard to delete a cached result with complex queries\nIf one piece of data changes such as a table cell, you need to delete all cached queries that might include the changed cell\n\nCaching at the object level\nSee your data as an object, similar to what you do with your application code.  Have your application assemble the dataset from the database into a class instance or a data structure(s):\n\nRemove the object from cache if its underlying data has changed\nAllows for asynchronous processing: workers assemble objects by consuming the latest cached object\n\nSuggestions of what to cache:\n\nUser sessions\nFully rendered web pages\nActivity streams\nUser graph data\n\nWhen to update the cache\nSince you can only store a limited amount of data in cache, you'll need to determine which cache update strategy works best for your use case.\nCache-aside\n\n\n\nSource: From cache to in-memory data grid\n\nThe application is responsible for reading and writing from storage.  The cache does not interact with storage directly.  The application does the following:\n\nLook for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss\nLoad entry from the database\nAdd entry to cache\nReturn entry\n\ndef get_user(self, user_id):\n    user = cache.get(\"user.{0}\", user_id)\n    if user is None:\n        user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}\", user_id)\n        if user is not None:\n            key = \"user.{0}\".format(user_id)\n            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))\n    return user\nMemcached is generally used in this manner.\nSubsequent reads of data added to cache are fast.  Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading.  Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn't requested.\nDisadvantage(s): cache-aside\n\nEach cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay.\nData can become stale if it is updated in the database.  This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.\nWhen a node fails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency.\n\nWrite-through\n\n\n\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\n\nThe application uses the cache as the main data store, reading and writing data to it, while the cache is responsible for reading and writing to the database:\n\nApplication adds\/updates entry in cache\nCache synchronously writes entry to data store\nReturn\n\nApplication code:\nset_user(12345, {\"foo\":\"bar\"})\nCache code:\ndef set_user(user_id, values):\n    user = db.query(\"UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}\", user_id, values)\n    cache.set(user_id, user)\nWrite-through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation, but subsequent reads of just written data are fast.  Users are generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data.  Data in the cache is not stale.\nDisadvantage(s): write through\n\nWhen a new node is created due to failure or scaling, the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database.  Cache-aside in conjunction with write through can mitigate this issue.\nMost data written might never be read, which can be minimized with a TTL.\n\nWrite-behind (write-back)\n\n\n\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\n\nIn write-behind, the application does the following:\n\nAdd\/update entry in cache\nAsynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance\n\nDisadvantage(s): write-behind\n\nThere could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.\nIt is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.\n\nRefresh-ahead\n\n\n\nSource: From cache to in-memory data grid\n\nYou can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently accessed cache entry prior to its expiration.\nRefresh-ahead can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future.\nDisadvantage(s): refresh-ahead\n\nNot accurately predicting which items are likely to be needed in the future can result in reduced performance than without refresh-ahead.\n\nDisadvantage(s): cache\n\nNeed to maintain consistency between caches and the source of truth such as the database through cache invalidation.\nCache invalidation is a difficult problem, there is additional complexity associated with when to update the cache.\nNeed to make application changes such as adding Redis or memcached.\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nFrom cache to in-memory data grid\nScalable system design patterns\nIntroduction to architecting systems for scale\nScalability, availability, stability, patterns\nScalability\nAWS ElastiCache strategies\nWikipedia\n\nAsynchronism\n\n\n\nSource: Intro to architecting systems for scale\n\nAsynchronous workflows help reduce request times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line.  They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data.\nMessage queues\nMessage queues receive, hold, and deliver messages.  If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow:\n\nAn application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status\nA worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete\n\nThe user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background.  During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed.  For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.\nRedis is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost.\nRabbitMQ is popular but requires you to adapt to the 'AMQP' protocol and manage your own nodes.\nAmazon SQS is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice.\nTask queues\nTasks queues receive tasks and their related data, runs them, then delivers their results.  They can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally-intensive jobs in the background.\nCelery has support for scheduling and primarily has python support.\nBack pressure\nIf queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance.  Back pressure can help by limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue.  Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later.  Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with exponential backoff.\nDisadvantage(s): asynchronism\n\nUse cases such as inexpensive calculations and realtime workflows might be better suited for synchronous operations, as introducing queues can add delays and complexity.\n\nSource(s) and further reading\n\nIt's all a numbers game\nApplying back pressure when overloaded\nLittle's law\nWhat is the difference between a message queue and a task queue?\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nSource: OSI 7 layer model\n\nHypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)\nHTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server.  It is a request\/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request.  HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.\nA basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint).  Below are common HTTP verbs:\n\n\n\nVerb\nDescription\nIdempotent*\nSafe\nCacheable\n\n\n\n\nGET\nReads a resource\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nPOST\nCreates a resource or trigger a process that handles data\nNo\nNo\nYes if response contains freshness info\n\n\nPUT\nCreates or replace a resource\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\nPATCH\nPartially updates a resource\nNo\nNo\nYes if response contains freshness info\n\n\nDELETE\nDeletes a resource\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n*Can be called many times without different outcomes.\nHTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as TCP and UDP.\nSource(s) and further reading: HTTP\n\nWhat is HTTP?\nDifference between HTTP and TCP\nDifference between PUT and PATCH\n\nTransmission control protocol (TCP)\n\n\n\nSource: How to make a multiplayer game\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an IP network.  Connection is established and terminated using a handshake.  All packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through:\n\nSequence numbers and checksum fields for each packet\nAcknowledgement packets and automatic retransmission\n\nIf the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets.  If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped.  TCP also implements flow control and congestion control.  These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.\nTo ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage.  It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a memcached server.  Connection pooling can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.\nTCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical.  Some examples include web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH.\nUse TCP over UDP when:\n\nYou need all of the data to arrive intact\nYou want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput\n\nUser datagram protocol (UDP)\n\n\n\nSource: How to make a multiplayer game\n\nUDP is connectionless.  Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level.  Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all.  UDP does not support congestion control.  Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient.\nUDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet.  This is useful with DHCP because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.\nUDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.\nUse UDP over TCP when:\n\nYou need the lowest latency\nLate data is worse than loss of data\nYou want to implement your own error correction\n\nSource(s) and further reading: TCP and UDP\n\nNetworking for game programming\nKey differences between TCP and UDP protocols\nDifference between TCP and UDP\nTransmission control protocol\nUser datagram protocol\nScaling memcache at Facebook\n\nRemote procedure call (RPC)\n\n\n\nSource: Crack the system design interview\n\nIn an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server.  The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program.  Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls.  Popular RPC frameworks include Protobuf, Thrift, and Avro.\nRPC is a request-response protocol:\n\nClient program - Calls the client stub procedure.  The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.\nClient stub procedure - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.\nClient communication module - OS sends the message from the client to the server.\nServer communication module - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.\nServer stub procedure -  Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.\nThe server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.\n\nSample RPC calls:\nGET \/someoperation?data=anId\n\nPOST \/anotheroperation\n{\n  \"data\":\"anId\";\n  \"anotherdata\": \"another value\"\n}\n\nRPC is focused on exposing behaviors.  RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.\nChoose a native library (aka SDK) when:\n\nYou know your target platform.\nYou want to control how your \"logic\" is accessed.\nYou want to control how error control happens off your library.\nPerformance and end user experience is your primary concern.\n\nHTTP APIs following REST tend to be used more often for public APIs.\nDisadvantage(s): RPC\n\nRPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.\nA new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.\nIt can be difficult to debug RPC.\nYou might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box.  For example, it might require additional effort to ensure RPC calls are properly cached on caching servers such as Squid.\n\nRepresentational state transfer (REST)\nREST is an architectural style enforcing a client\/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server.  The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.  All communication must be stateless and cacheable.\nThere are four qualities of a RESTful interface:\n\nIdentify resources (URI in HTTP) - use the same URI regardless of any operation.\nChange with representations (Verbs in HTTP) - use verbs, headers, and body.\nSelf-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP) - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.\nHATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.\n\nSample REST calls:\nGET \/someresources\/anId\n\nPUT \/someresources\/anId\n{\"anotherdata\": \"another value\"}\n\nREST is focused on exposing data.  It minimizes the coupling between client\/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs.  REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, representation through headers, and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.  Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.\nDisadvantage(s): REST\n\nWith REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy.  For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path.  With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.\nREST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case.  For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.\nFetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views, e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry. For mobile applications operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable.\nOver time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those that they do not need, as a result, it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies.\n\nRPC and REST calls comparison\n\n\n\nOperation\nRPC\nREST\n\n\n\n\nSignup\nPOST \/signup\nPOST \/persons\n\n\nResign\nPOST \/resign{\"personid\": \"1234\"}\nDELETE \/persons\/1234\n\n\nRead a person\nGET \/readPerson?personid=1234\nGET \/persons\/1234\n\n\nRead a person\u2019s items list\nGET \/readUsersItemsList?personid=1234\nGET \/persons\/1234\/items\n\n\nAdd an item to a person\u2019s items\nPOST \/addItemToUsersItemsList{\"personid\": \"1234\";\"itemid\": \"456\"}\nPOST \/persons\/1234\/items{\"itemid\": \"456\"}\n\n\nUpdate an item\nPOST \/modifyItem{\"itemid\": \"456\";\"key\": \"value\"}\nPUT \/items\/456{\"key\": \"value\"}\n\n\nDelete an item\nPOST \/removeItem{\"itemid\": \"456\"}\nDELETE \/items\/456\n\n\n\n\nSource: Do you really know why you prefer REST over RPC\n\nSource(s) and further reading: REST and RPC\n\nDo you really know why you prefer REST over RPC\nWhen are RPC-ish approaches more appropriate than REST?\nREST vs JSON-RPC\nDebunking the myths of RPC and REST\nWhat are the drawbacks of using REST\nCrack the system design interview\nThrift\nWhy REST for internal use and not RPC\n\nSecurity\nThis section could use some updates.

On Linux and macOS, the system wide configuration file is located at \/etc\/youtube-dl.conf and the user wide configuration file at ~\/.config\/youtube-dl\/config. On Windows, the user wide configuration file locations are %APPDATA%\\youtube-dl\\config.txt or C:\\Users\\<user name>\\youtube-dl.conf. Note that by default configuration file may not exist so you may need to create it yourself.\nFor example, with the following configuration file youtube-dl will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory:\n# Lines starting with # are comments\n\n# Always extract audio\n-x\n\n# Do not copy the mtime\n--no-mtime\n\n# Use this proxy\n--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128\n\n# Save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory\n-o ~\/Movies\/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n\nNote that options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls thus there must be no whitespace after - or --, e.g. -o or --proxy but not - o or -- proxy.\nYou can use --ignore-config if you want to disable the configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.\nYou can also use --config-location if you want to use custom configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.\nAuthentication with .netrc file\nYou may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with --username and --password) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every youtube-dl execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a .netrc file on a per extractor basis. For that you will need to create a .netrc file in your $HOME and restrict permissions to read\/write by only you:\ntouch $HOME\/.netrc\nchmod a-rwx,u+rw $HOME\/.netrc\n\nAfter that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where extractor is the name of the extractor in lowercase:\nmachine <extractor> login <login> password <password>\n\nFor example:\nmachine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password\nmachine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password\n\nTo activate authentication with the .netrc file you should pass --netrc to youtube-dl or place it in the configuration file.\nOn Windows you may also need to setup the %HOME% environment variable manually. For example:\nset HOME=%USERPROFILE%\n\nOUTPUT TEMPLATE\nThe -o option allows users to indicate a template for the output file names.\ntl;dr: navigate me to examples.\nThe basic usage is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like in youtube-dl -o funny_video.flv \"https:\/\/some\/video\". However, it may contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video. The special sequences may be formatted according to python string formatting operations. For example, %(NAME)s or %(NAME)05d. To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed by formatting operations. Allowed names along with sequence type are:\n\nid (string): Video identifier\ntitle (string): Video title\nurl (string): Video URL\next (string): Video filename extension\nalt_title (string): A secondary title of the video\ndisplay_id (string): An alternative identifier for the video\nuploader (string): Full name of the video uploader\nlicense (string): License name the video is licensed under\ncreator (string): The creator of the video\nrelease_date (string): The date (YYYYMMDD) when the video was released\ntimestamp (numeric): UNIX timestamp of the moment the video became available\nupload_date (string): Video upload date (YYYYMMDD)\nuploader_id (string): Nickname or id of the video uploader\nchannel (string): Full name of the channel the video is uploaded on\nchannel_id (string): Id of the channel\nlocation (string): Physical location where the video was filmed\nduration (numeric): Length of the video in seconds\nview_count (numeric): How many users have watched the video on the platform\nlike_count (numeric): Number of positive ratings of the video\ndislike_count (numeric): Number of negative ratings of the video\nrepost_count (numeric): Number of reposts of the video\naverage_rating (numeric): Average rating give by users, the scale used depends on the webpage\ncomment_count (numeric): Number of comments on the video\nage_limit (numeric): Age restriction for the video (years)\nis_live (boolean): Whether this video is a live stream or a fixed-length video\nstart_time (numeric): Time in seconds where the reproduction should start, as specified in the URL\nend_time (numeric): Time in seconds where the reproduction should end, as specified in the URL\nformat (string): A human-readable description of the format\nformat_id (string): Format code specified by --format\nformat_note (string): Additional info about the format\nwidth (numeric): Width of the video\nheight (numeric): Height of the video\nresolution (string): Textual description of width and height\ntbr (numeric): Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit\/s\nabr (numeric): Average audio bitrate in KBit\/s\nacodec (string): Name of the audio codec in use\nasr (numeric): Audio sampling rate in Hertz\nvbr (numeric): Average video bitrate in KBit\/s\nfps (numeric): Frame rate\nvcodec (string): Name of the video codec in use\ncontainer (string): Name of the container format\nfilesize (numeric): The number of bytes, if known in advance\nfilesize_approx (numeric): An estimate for the number of bytes\nprotocol (string): The protocol that will be used for the actual download\nextractor (string): Name of the extractor\nextractor_key (string): Key name of the extractor\nepoch (numeric): Unix epoch when creating the file\nautonumber (numeric): Number that will be increased with each download, starting at --autonumber-start\nplaylist (string): Name or id of the playlist that contains the video\nplaylist_index (numeric): Index of the video in the playlist padded with leading zeros according to the total length of the playlist\nplaylist_id (string): Playlist identifier\nplaylist_title (string): Playlist title\nplaylist_uploader (string): Full name of the playlist uploader\nplaylist_uploader_id (string): Nickname or id of the playlist uploader\n\nAvailable for the video that belongs to some logical chapter or section:\n\nchapter (string): Name or title of the chapter the video belongs to\nchapter_number (numeric): Number of the chapter the video belongs to\nchapter_id (string): Id of the chapter the video belongs to\n\nAvailable for the video that is an episode of some series or programme:\n\nseries (string): Title of the series or programme the video episode belongs to\nseason (string): Title of the season the video episode belongs to\nseason_number (numeric): Number of the season the video episode belongs to\nseason_id (string): Id of the season the video episode belongs to\nepisode (string): Title of the video episode\nepisode_number (numeric): Number of the video episode within a season\nepisode_id (string): Id of the video episode\n\nAvailable for the media that is a track or a part of a music album:\n\ntrack (string): Title of the track\ntrack_number (numeric): Number of the track within an album or a disc\ntrack_id (string): Id of the track\nartist (string): Artist(s) of the track\ngenre (string): Genre(s) of the track\nalbum (string): Title of the album the track belongs to\nalbum_type (string): Type of the album\nalbum_artist (string): List of all artists appeared on the album\ndisc_number (numeric): Number of the disc or other physical medium the track belongs to\nrelease_year (numeric): Year (YYYY) when the album was released\n\nEach aforementioned sequence when referenced in an output template will be replaced by the actual value corresponding to the sequence name. Note that some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present since they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor. Such sequences will be replaced with NA.\nFor example for -o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s and an mp4 video with title youtube-dl test video and id BaW_jenozKcj, this will result in a youtube-dl test video-BaW_jenozKcj.mp4 file created in the current directory.\nFor numeric sequences you can use numeric related formatting, for example, %(view_count)05d will result in a string with view count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in 00042.\nOutput templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g. -o '%(playlist)s\/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s' which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template. Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.\nTo use percent literals in an output template use %%. To output to stdout use -o -.\nThe current default template is %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s.\nIn some cases, you don't want special characters such as \u4e2d, spaces, or &, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. In these cases, add the --restrict-filenames flag to get a shorter title:\nOutput template and Windows batch files\nIf you are using an output template inside a Windows batch file then you must escape plain percent characters (%) by doubling, so that -o \"%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s\" should become -o \"%%(title)s-%%(id)s.%%(ext)s\". However you should not touch %'s that are not plain characters, e.g. environment variables for expansion should stay intact: -o \"C:\\%HOMEPATH%\\Desktop\\%%(title)s.%%(ext)s\".\nOutput template examples\nNote that on Windows you may need to use double quotes instead of single.\n$ youtube-dl --get-filename -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' BaW_jenozKc\nyoutube-dl test video ''_\u00e4\u21ad\ud835\udd50.mp4    # All kinds of weird characters\n\n$ youtube-dl --get-filename -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' BaW_jenozKc --restrict-filenames\nyoutube-dl_test_video_.mp4          # A simple file name\n\n# Download YouTube playlist videos in separate directory indexed by video order in a playlist\n$ youtube-dl -o '%(playlist)s\/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s' https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\n\n# Download all playlists of YouTube channel\/user keeping each playlist in separate directory:\n$ youtube-dl -o '%(uploader)s\/%(playlist)s\/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s' https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TheLinuxFoundation\/playlists\n\n# Download Udemy course keeping each chapter in separate directory under MyVideos directory in your home\n$ youtube-dl -u user -p password -o '~\/MyVideos\/%(playlist)s\/%(chapter_number)s - %(chapter)s\/%(title)s.%(ext)s' https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/java-tutorial\/\n\n# Download entire series season keeping each series and each season in separate directory under C:\/MyVideos\n$ youtube-dl -o \"C:\/MyVideos\/%(series)s\/%(season_number)s - %(season)s\/%(episode_number)s - %(episode)s.%(ext)s\" https:\/\/videomore.ru\/kino_v_detalayah\/5_sezon\/367617\n\n# Stream the video being downloaded to stdout\n$ youtube-dl -o - BaW_jenozKc\nFORMAT SELECTION\nBy default youtube-dl tries to download the best available quality, i.e. if you want the best quality you don't need to pass any special options, youtube-dl will guess it for you by default.\nBut sometimes you may want to download in a different format, for example when you are on a slow or intermittent connection. The key mechanism for achieving this is so-called format selection based on which you can explicitly specify desired format, select formats based on some criterion or criteria, setup precedence and much more.\nThe general syntax for format selection is --format FORMAT or shorter -f FORMAT where FORMAT is a selector expression, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.\ntl;dr: navigate me to examples.\nThe simplest case is requesting a specific format, for example with -f 22 you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using --list-formats or -F. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.\nYou can also use a file extension (currently 3gp, aac, flv, m4a, mp3, mp4, ogg, wav, webm are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g. -f webm will download the best quality format with the webm extension served as a single file.\nYou can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:\n\nbest: Select the best quality format represented by a single file with video and audio.\nworst: Select the worst quality format represented by a single file with video and audio.\nbestvideo: Select the best quality video-only format (e.g. DASH video). May not be available.\nworstvideo: Select the worst quality video-only format. May not be available.\nbestaudio: Select the best quality audio only-format. May not be available.\nworstaudio: Select the worst quality audio only-format. May not be available.\n\nFor example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use -f worstvideo.\nIf you want to download multiple videos and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that slash is left-associative, i.e. formats on the left hand side are preferred, for example -f 22\/17\/18 will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.\nIf you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g. -f 22,17,18 will download all these three formats, of course if they are available. Or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature: -f 136\/137\/mp4\/bestvideo,140\/m4a\/bestaudio.\nYou can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in -f \"best[height=720]\" (or -f \"[filesize>10M]\").\nThe following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons <, <=, >, >=, = (equals), != (not equals):\n\nfilesize: The number of bytes, if known in advance\nwidth: Width of the video, if known\nheight: Height of the video, if known\ntbr: Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit\/s\nabr: Average audio bitrate in KBit\/s\nvbr: Average video bitrate in KBit\/s\nasr: Audio sampling rate in Hertz\nfps: Frame rate\n\nAlso filtering work for comparisons = (equals), ^= (starts with), $= (ends with), *= (contains) and following string meta fields:\n\next: File extension\nacodec: Name of the audio codec in use\nvcodec: Name of the video codec in use\ncontainer: Name of the container format\nprotocol: The protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (http, https, rtsp, rtmp, rtmpe, mms, f4m, ism, http_dash_segments, m3u8, or m3u8_native)\nformat_id: A short description of the format\n\nAny string comparison may be prefixed with negation ! in order to produce an opposite comparison, e.g. !*= (does not contain).\nNote that none of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular extractor, i.e. the metadata offered by the video hoster.\nFormats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (?) after the operator. You can combine format filters, so -f \"[height <=? 720][tbr>500]\" selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 KBit\/s.\nYou can merge the video and audio of two formats into a single file using -f <video-format>+<audio-format> (requires ffmpeg or avconv installed), for example -f bestvideo+bestaudio will download the best video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg\/avconv.\nFormat selectors can also be grouped using parentheses, for example if you want to download the best mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480 you can use -f '(mp4,webm)[height<480]'.\nSince the end of April 2015 and version 2015.04.26, youtube-dl uses -f bestvideo+bestaudio\/best as the default format selection (see #5447, #5456). If ffmpeg or avconv are installed this results in downloading bestvideo and bestaudio separately and muxing them together into a single file giving the best overall quality available. Otherwise it falls back to best and results in downloading the best available quality served as a single file. best is also needed for videos that don't come from YouTube because they don't provide the audio and video in two different files. If you want to only download some DASH formats (for example if you are not interested in getting videos with a resolution higher than 1080p), you can add -f bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio\/best to your configuration file. Note that if you use youtube-dl to stream to stdout (and most likely to pipe it to your media player then), i.e. you explicitly specify output template as -o -, youtube-dl still uses -f best format selection in order to start content delivery immediately to your player and not to wait until bestvideo and bestaudio are downloaded and muxed.\nIf you want to preserve the old format selection behavior (prior to youtube-dl 2015.04.26), i.e. you want to download the best available quality media served as a single file, you should explicitly specify your choice with -f best. You may want to add it to the configuration file in order not to type it every time you run youtube-dl.\nFormat selection examples\nNote that on Windows you may need to use double quotes instead of single.\n# Download best mp4 format available or any other best if no mp4 available\n$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]\/best[ext=mp4]\/best'\n\n# Download best format available but no better than 480p\n$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[height<=480]+bestaudio\/best[height<=480]'\n\n# Download best video only format but no bigger than 50 MB\n$ youtube-dl -f 'best[filesize<50M]'\n\n# Download best format available via direct link over HTTP\/HTTPS protocol\n$ youtube-dl -f '(bestvideo+bestaudio\/best)[protocol^=http]'\n\n# Download the best video format and the best audio format without merging them\n$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo,bestaudio' -o '%(title)s.f%(format_id)s.%(ext)s'\nNote that in the last example, an output template is recommended as bestvideo and bestaudio may have the same file name.\nVIDEO SELECTION\nVideos can be filtered by their upload date using the options --date, --datebefore or --dateafter. They accept dates in two formats:\n\nAbsolute dates: Dates in the format YYYYMMDD.\nRelative dates: Dates in the format (now|today)[+-][0-9](day|week|month|year)(s)?\n\nExamples:\n# Download only the videos uploaded in the last 6 months\n$ youtube-dl --dateafter now-6months\n\n# Download only the videos uploaded on January 1, 1970\n$ youtube-dl --date 19700101\n\n$ # Download only the videos uploaded in the 200x decade\n$ youtube-dl --dateafter 20000101 --datebefore 20091231\nFAQ\nHow do I update youtube-dl?\nIf you've followed our manual installation instructions, you can simply run youtube-dl -U (or, on Linux, sudo youtube-dl -U).\nIf you have used pip, a simple sudo pip install -U youtube-dl is sufficient to update.\nIf you have installed youtube-dl using a package manager like apt-get or yum, use the standard system update mechanism to update. Note that distribution packages are often outdated. As a rule of thumb, youtube-dl releases at least once a month, and often weekly or even daily. Simply go to https:\/\/yt-dl.org to find out the current version. Unfortunately, there is nothing we youtube-dl developers can do if your distribution serves a really outdated version. You can (and should) complain to your distribution in their bugtracker or support forum.\nAs a last resort, you can also uninstall the version installed by your package manager and follow our manual installation instructions. For that, remove the distribution's package, with a line like\nsudo apt-get remove -y youtube-dl\n\nAfterwards, simply follow our manual installation instructions:\nsudo wget https:\/\/yt-dl.org\/downloads\/latest\/youtube-dl -O \/usr\/local\/bin\/youtube-dl\nsudo chmod a+rx \/usr\/local\/bin\/youtube-dl\nhash -r\n\nAgain, from then on you'll be able to update with sudo youtube-dl -U.\nyoutube-dl is extremely slow to start on Windows\nAdd a file exclusion for youtube-dl.exe in Windows Defender settings.\nI'm getting an error Unable to extract OpenGraph title on YouTube playlists\nYouTube changed their playlist format in March 2014 and later on, so you'll need at least youtube-dl 2014.07.25 to download all YouTube videos.\nIf you have installed youtube-dl with a package manager, pip, setup.py or a tarball, please use that to update. Note that Ubuntu packages do not seem to get updated anymore. Since we are not affiliated with Ubuntu, there is little we can do. Feel free to report bugs to the Ubuntu packaging people - all they have to do is update the package to a somewhat recent version. See above for a way to update.\nI'm getting an error when trying to use output template: error: using output template conflicts with using title, video ID or auto number\nMake sure you are not using -o with any of these options -t, --title, --id, -A or --auto-number set in command line or in a configuration file. Remove the latter if any.\nDo I always have to pass -citw?\nBy default, youtube-dl intends to have the best options (incidentally, if you have a convincing case that these should be different, please file an issue where you explain that). Therefore, it is unnecessary and sometimes harmful to copy long option strings from webpages. In particular, the only option out of -citw that is regularly useful is -i.\nCan you please put the -b option back?\nMost people asking this question are not aware that youtube-dl now defaults to downloading the highest available quality as reported by YouTube, which will be 1080p or 720p in some cases, so you no longer need the -b option. For some specific videos, maybe YouTube does not report them to be available in a specific high quality format you're interested in. In that case, simply request it with the -f option and youtube-dl will try to download it.\nI get HTTP error 402 when trying to download a video. What's this?\nApparently YouTube requires you to pass a CAPTCHA test if you download too much. We're considering to provide a way to let you solve the CAPTCHA, but at the moment, your best course of action is pointing a web browser to the youtube URL, solving the CAPTCHA, and restart youtube-dl.\nDo I need any other programs?\nyoutube-dl works fine on its own on most sites. However, if you want to convert video\/audio, you'll need avconv or ffmpeg. On some sites - most notably YouTube - videos can be retrieved in a higher quality format without sound. youtube-dl will detect whether avconv\/ffmpeg is present and automatically pick the best option.\nVideos or video formats streamed via RTMP protocol can only be downloaded when rtmpdump is installed. Downloading MMS and RTSP videos requires either mplayer or mpv to be installed.\nI have downloaded a video but how can I play it?\nOnce the video is fully downloaded, use any video player, such as mpv, vlc or mplayer.\nI extracted a video URL with -g, but it does not play on another machine \/ in my web browser.\nIt depends a lot on the service. In many cases, requests for the video (to download\/play it) must come from the same IP address and with the same cookies and\/or HTTP headers. Use the --cookies option to write the required cookies into a file, and advise your downloader to read cookies from that file. Some sites also require a common user agent to be used, use --dump-user-agent to see the one in use by youtube-dl. You can also get necessary cookies and HTTP headers from JSON output obtained with --dump-json.\nIt may be beneficial to use IPv6; in some cases, the restrictions are only applied to IPv4. Some services (sometimes only for a subset of videos) do not restrict the video URL by IP address, cookie, or user-agent, but these are the exception rather than the rule.\nPlease bear in mind that some URL protocols are not supported by browsers out of the box, including RTMP. If you are using -g, your own downloader must support these as well.\nIf you want to play the video on a machine that is not running youtube-dl, you can relay the video content from the machine that runs youtube-dl. You can use -o - to let youtube-dl stream a video to stdout, or simply allow the player to download the files written by youtube-dl in turn.\nERROR: no fmt_url_map or conn information found in video info\nYouTube has switched to a new video info format in July 2011 which is not supported by old versions of youtube-dl. See above for how to update youtube-dl.\nERROR: unable to download video\nYouTube requires an additional signature since September 2012 which is not supported by old versions of youtube-dl. See above for how to update youtube-dl.\nVideo URL contains an ampersand and I'm getting some strange output [1] 2839 or 'v' is not recognized as an internal or external command\nThat's actually the output from your shell. Since ampersand is one of the special shell characters it's interpreted by the shell preventing you from passing the whole URL to youtube-dl. To disable your shell from interpreting the ampersands (or any other special characters) you have to either put the whole URL in quotes or escape them with a backslash (which approach will work depends on your shell).\nFor example if your URL is https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=4&v=BaW_jenozKc you should end up with following command:\nyoutube-dl 'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=4&v=BaW_jenozKc'\nor\nyoutube-dl https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=4\\&v=BaW_jenozKc\nFor Windows you have to use the double quotes:\nyoutube-dl \"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=4&v=BaW_jenozKc\"\nExtractorError: Could not find JS function u'OF'\nIn February 2015, the new YouTube player contained a character sequence in a string that was misinterpreted by old versions of youtube-dl. See above for how to update youtube-dl.\nHTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests or 402: Payment Required\nThese two error codes indicate that the service is blocking your IP address because of overuse. Usually this is a soft block meaning that you can gain access again after solving CAPTCHA. Just open a browser and solve a CAPTCHA the service suggests you and after that pass cookies to youtube-dl. Note that if your machine has multiple external IPs then you should also pass exactly the same IP you've used for solving CAPTCHA with --source-address. Also you may need to pass a User-Agent HTTP header of your browser with --user-agent.\nIf this is not the case (no CAPTCHA suggested to solve by the service) then you can contact the service and ask them to unblock your IP address, or - if you have acquired a whitelisted IP address already - use the --proxy or --source-address options to select another IP address.\nSyntaxError: Non-ASCII character\nThe error\nFile \"youtube-dl\", line 2\nSyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\\x93' ...\n\nmeans you're using an outdated version of Python. Please update to Python 2.6 or 2.7.\nWhat is this binary file? Where has the code gone?\nSince June 2012 (#342) youtube-dl is packed as an executable zipfile, simply unzip it (might need renaming to youtube-dl.zip first on some systems) or clone the git repository, as laid out above. If you modify the code, you can run it by executing the __main__.py file. To recompile the executable, run make youtube-dl.\nThe exe throws an error due to missing MSVCR100.dll\nTo run the exe you need to install first the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86).\nOn Windows, how should I set up ffmpeg and youtube-dl? Where should I put the exe files?\nIf you put youtube-dl and ffmpeg in the same directory that you're running the command from, it will work, but that's rather cumbersome.\nTo make a different directory work - either for ffmpeg, or for youtube-dl, or for both - simply create the directory (say, C:\\bin, or C:\\Users\\<User name>\\bin), put all the executables directly in there, and then set your PATH environment variable to include that directory.\nFrom then on, after restarting your shell, you will be able to access both youtube-dl and ffmpeg (and youtube-dl will be able to find ffmpeg) by simply typing youtube-dl or ffmpeg, no matter what directory you're in.\nHow do I put downloads into a specific folder?\nUse the -o to specify an output template, for example -o \"\/home\/user\/videos\/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s\". If you want this for all of your downloads, put the option into your configuration file.\nHow do I download a video starting with a -?\nEither prepend https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v= or separate the ID from the options with --:\nyoutube-dl -- -wNyEUrxzFU\nyoutube-dl \"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-wNyEUrxzFU\"\n\nHow do I pass cookies to youtube-dl?\nUse the --cookies option, for example --cookies \/path\/to\/cookies\/file.txt.\nIn order to extract cookies from browser use any conforming browser extension for exporting cookies. For example, cookies.txt (for Chrome) or cookies.txt (for Firefox).\nNote that the cookies file must be in Mozilla\/Netscape format and the first line of the cookies file must be either # HTTP Cookie File or # Netscape HTTP Cookie File. Make sure you have correct newline format in the cookies file and convert newlines if necessary to correspond with your OS, namely CRLF (\\r\\n) for Windows and LF (\\n) for Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.). HTTP Error 400: Bad Request when using --cookies is a good sign of invalid newline format.\nPassing cookies to youtube-dl is a good way to workaround login when a particular extractor does not implement it explicitly. Another use case is working around CAPTCHA some websites require you to solve in particular cases in order to get access (e.g. YouTube, CloudFlare).\nHow do I stream directly to media player?\nYou will first need to tell youtube-dl to stream media to stdout with -o -, and also tell your media player to read from stdin (it must be capable of this for streaming) and then pipe former to latter. For example, streaming to vlc can be achieved with:\nyoutube-dl -o - \"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BaW_jenozKcj\" | vlc -\n\nHow do I download only new videos from a playlist?\nUse download-archive feature. With this feature you should initially download the complete playlist with --download-archive \/path\/to\/download\/archive\/file.txt that will record identifiers of all the videos in a special file. Each subsequent run with the same --download-archive will download only new videos and skip all videos that have been downloaded before. Note that only successful downloads are recorded in the file.\nFor example, at first,\nyoutube-dl --download-archive archive.txt \"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\n\nwill download the complete PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re playlist and create a file archive.txt. Each subsequent run will only download new videos if any:\nyoutube-dl --download-archive archive.txt \"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\n\nShould I add --hls-prefer-native into my config?\nWhen youtube-dl detects an HLS video, it can download it either with the built-in downloader or ffmpeg. Since many HLS streams are slightly invalid and ffmpeg\/youtube-dl each handle some invalid cases better than the other, there is an option to switch the downloader if needed.\nWhen youtube-dl knows that one particular downloader works better for a given website, that downloader will be picked. Otherwise, youtube-dl will pick the best downloader for general compatibility, which at the moment happens to be ffmpeg. This choice may change in future versions of youtube-dl, with improvements of the built-in downloader and\/or ffmpeg.\nIn particular, the generic extractor (used when your website is not in the list of supported sites by youtube-dl cannot mandate one specific downloader.\nIf you put either --hls-prefer-native or --hls-prefer-ffmpeg into your configuration, a different subset of videos will fail to download correctly. Instead, it is much better to file an issue or a pull request which details why the native or the ffmpeg HLS downloader is a better choice for your use case.\nCan you add support for this anime video site, or site which shows current movies for free?\nAs a matter of policy (as well as legality), youtube-dl does not include support for services that specialize in infringing copyright. As a rule of thumb, if you cannot easily find a video that the service is quite obviously allowed to distribute (i.e. that has been uploaded by the creator, the creator's distributor, or is published under a free license), the service is probably unfit for inclusion to youtube-dl.\nA note on the service that they don't host the infringing content, but just link to those who do, is evidence that the service should not be included into youtube-dl. The same goes for any DMCA note when the whole front page of the service is filled with videos they are not allowed to distribute. A \"fair use\" note is equally unconvincing if the service shows copyright-protected videos in full without authorization.\nSupport requests for services that do purchase the rights to distribute their content are perfectly fine though. If in doubt, you can simply include a source that mentions the legitimate purchase of content.\nHow can I speed up work on my issue?\n(Also known as: Help, my important issue not being solved!) The youtube-dl core developer team is quite small. While we do our best to solve as many issues as possible, sometimes that can take quite a while. To speed up your issue, here's what you can do:\nFirst of all, please do report the issue at our issue tracker. That allows us to coordinate all efforts by users and developers, and serves as a unified point. Unfortunately, the youtube-dl project has grown too large to use personal email as an effective communication channel.\nPlease read the bug reporting instructions below. A lot of bugs lack all the necessary information. If you can, offer proxy, VPN, or shell access to the youtube-dl developers. If you are able to, test the issue from multiple computers in multiple countries to exclude local censorship or misconfiguration issues.\nIf nobody is interested in solving your issue, you are welcome to take matters into your own hands and submit a pull request (or coerce\/pay somebody else to do so).\nFeel free to bump the issue from time to time by writing a small comment (\"Issue is still present in youtube-dl version ...from France, but fixed from Belgium\"), but please not more than once a month. Please do not declare your issue as important or urgent.\nHow can I detect whether a given URL is supported by youtube-dl?\nFor one, have a look at the list of supported sites. Note that it can sometimes happen that the site changes its URL scheme (say, from https:\/\/example.com\/video\/1234567 to https:\/\/example.com\/v\/1234567 ) and youtube-dl reports an URL of a service in that list as unsupported. In that case, simply report a bug.\nIt is not possible to detect whether a URL is supported or not. That's because youtube-dl contains a generic extractor which matches all URLs. You may be tempted to disable, exclude, or remove the generic extractor, but the generic extractor not only allows users to extract videos from lots of websites that embed a video from another service, but may also be used to extract video from a service that it's hosting itself. Therefore, we neither recommend nor support disabling, excluding, or removing the generic extractor.\nIf you want to find out whether a given URL is supported, simply call youtube-dl with it. If you get no videos back, chances are the URL is either not referring to a video or unsupported. You can find out which by examining the output (if you run youtube-dl on the console) or catching an UnsupportedError exception if you run it from a Python program.\nWhy do I need to go through that much red tape when filing bugs?\nBefore we had the issue template, despite our extensive bug reporting instructions, about 80% of the issue reports we got were useless, for instance because people used ancient versions hundreds of releases old, because of simple syntactic errors (not in youtube-dl but in general shell usage), because the problem was already reported multiple times before, because people did not actually read an error message, even if it said \"please install ffmpeg\", because people did not mention the URL they were trying to download and many more simple, easy-to-avoid problems, many of whom were totally unrelated to youtube-dl.\nyoutube-dl is an open-source project manned by too few volunteers, so we'd rather spend time fixing bugs where we are certain none of those simple problems apply, and where we can be reasonably confident to be able to reproduce the issue without asking the reporter repeatedly. As such, the output of youtube-dl -v YOUR_URL_HERE is really all that's required to file an issue. The issue template also guides you through some basic steps you can do, such as checking that your version of youtube-dl is current.\nDEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS\nMost users do not need to build youtube-dl and can download the builds or get them from their distribution.\nTo run youtube-dl as a developer, you don't need to build anything either. Simply execute\npython -m youtube_dl\n\nTo run the test, simply invoke your favorite test runner, or execute a test file directly; any of the following work:\npython -m unittest discover\npython test\/test_download.py\nnosetests\n\nSee item 6 of new extractor tutorial for how to run extractor specific test cases.\nIf you want to create a build of youtube-dl yourself, you'll need\n\npython\nmake (only GNU make is supported)\npandoc\nzip\nnosetests\n\nAdding support for a new site\nIf you want to add support for a new site, first of all make sure this site is not dedicated to copyright infringement. youtube-dl does not support such sites thus pull requests adding support for them will be rejected.\nAfter you have ensured this site is distributing its content legally, you can follow this quick list (assuming your service is called yourextractor):\n\n\nFork this repository\n\n\nCheck out the source code with:\n git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME\/youtube-dl.git\n\n\n\nStart a new git branch with\n cd youtube-dl\n git checkout -b yourextractor\n\n\n\nStart with this simple template and save it to youtube_dl\/extractor\/yourextractor.py:\n# coding: utf-8\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\n\nfrom .common import InfoExtractor\n\n\nclass YourExtractorIE(InfoExtractor):\n    _VALID_URL = r'https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?yourextractor\\.com\/watch\/(?P<id>[0-9]+)'\n    _TEST = {\n        'url': 'https:\/\/yourextractor.com\/watch\/42',\n        'md5': 'TODO: md5 sum of the first 10241 bytes of the video file (use --test)',\n        'info_dict': {\n            'id': '42',\n            'ext': 'mp4',\n            'title': 'Video title goes here',\n            'thumbnail': r're:^https?:\/\/.*\\.jpg$',\n            # TODO more properties, either as:\n            # * A value\n            # * MD5 checksum; start the string with md5:\n            # * A regular expression; start the string with re:\n            # * Any Python type (for example int or float)\n        }\n    }\n\n    def _real_extract(self, url):\n        video_id = self._match_id(url)\n        webpage = self._download_webpage(url, video_id)\n\n        # TODO more code goes here, for example ...\n        title = self._html_search_regex(r'<h1>(.+?)<\/h1>', webpage, 'title')\n\n        return {\n            'id': video_id,\n            'title': title,\n            'description': self._og_search_description(webpage),\n            'uploader': self._search_regex(r'<div[^>]+id=\"uploader\"[^>]*>([^<]+)<', webpage, 'uploader', fatal=False),\n            # TODO more properties (see youtube_dl\/extractor\/common.py)\n        }\n\n\nAdd an import in youtube_dl\/extractor\/extractors.py.\n\n\nRun python test\/test_download.py TestDownload.test_YourExtractor. This should fail at first, but you can continually re-run it until you're done. If you decide to add more than one test, then rename _TEST to _TESTS and make it into a list of dictionaries. The tests will then be named TestDownload.test_YourExtractor, TestDownload.test_YourExtractor_1, TestDownload.test_YourExtractor_2, etc. Note that tests with only_matching key in test's dict are not counted in.\n\n\nHave a look at youtube_dl\/extractor\/common.py for possible helper methods and a detailed description of what your extractor should and may return. Add tests and code for as many as you want.\n\n\nMake sure your code follows youtube-dl coding conventions and check the code with flake8:\n $ flake8 youtube_dl\/extractor\/yourextractor.py\n\n\n\nMake sure your code works under all Python versions claimed supported by youtube-dl, namely 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2+.\n\n\nWhen the tests pass, add the new files and commit them and push the result, like this:\n$ git add youtube_dl\/extractor\/extractors.py\n$ git add youtube_dl\/extractor\/yourextractor.py\n$ git commit -m '[yourextractor] Add new extractor'\n$ git push origin yourextractor\n\n\n\nFinally, create a pull request. We'll then review and merge it.\n\n\nIn any case, thank you very much for your contributions!\nyoutube-dl coding conventions\nThis section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.\nExtractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change. As an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that. This is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old youtube-dl versions working. Even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by emitting a new version of youtube-dl with a fix incorporated, all the previous versions become broken in all repositories and distros' packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from us. Needless to say, some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all.\nMandatory and optional metafields\nFor extraction to work youtube-dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube-dl expressed by an information dictionary or simply info dict. Only the following meta fields in the info dict are considered mandatory for a successful extraction process by youtube-dl:\n\nid (media identifier)\ntitle (media title)\nurl (media download URL) or formats\n\nIn fact only the last option is technically mandatory (i.e. if you can't figure out the download location of the media the extraction does not make any sense). But by convention youtube-dl also treats id and title as mandatory. Thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is considered completely broken.\nAny field apart from the aforementioned ones are considered optional. That means that extraction should be tolerant to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always available at the moment) and future-proof in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.\nExample\nSay you have some source dictionary meta that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key summary:\nmeta = self._download_json(url, video_id)\nAssume at this point meta's layout is:\n{\n    ...\n    \"summary\": \"some fancy summary text\",\n    ...\n}\nAssume you want to extract summary and put it into the resulting info dict as description. Since description is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the meta dict, so that you should extract it like:\ndescription = meta.get('summary')  # correct\nand not like:\ndescription = meta['summary']  # incorrect\nThe latter will break extraction process with KeyError if summary disappears from meta at some later time but with the former approach extraction will just go ahead with description set to None which is perfectly fine (remember None is equivalent to the absence of data).\nSimilarly, you should pass fatal=False when extracting optional data from a webpage with _search_regex, _html_search_regex or similar methods, for instance:\ndescription = self._search_regex(\n    r'<span[^>]+id=\"title\"[^>]*>([^<]+)<',\n    webpage, 'description', fatal=False)\nWith fatal set to False if _search_regex fails to extract description it will emit a warning and continue extraction.\nYou can also pass default=<some fallback value>, for example:\ndescription = self._search_regex(\n    r'<span[^>]+id=\"title\"[^>]*>([^<]+)<',\n    webpage, 'description', default=None)\nOn failure this code will silently continue the extraction with description set to None. That is useful for metafields that may or may not be present.\nProvide fallbacks\nWhen extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources. For example if title is present in several places, try extracting from at least some of them. This makes it more future-proof in case some of the sources become unavailable.\nExample\nSay meta from the previous example has a title and you are about to extract it. Since title is a mandatory meta field you should end up with something like:\ntitle = meta['title']\nIf title disappears from meta in future due to some changes on the hoster's side the extraction would fail since title is mandatory. That's expected.\nAssume that you have some another source you can extract title from, for example og:title HTML meta of a webpage. In this case you can provide a fallback scenario:\ntitle = meta.get('title') or self._og_search_title(webpage)\nThis code will try to extract from meta first and if it fails it will try extracting og:title from a webpage.\nRegular expressions\nDon't capture groups you don't use\nCapturing group must be an indication that it's used somewhere in the code. Any group that is not used must be non capturing.\nExample\nDon't capture id attribute name here since you can't use it for anything anyway.\nCorrect:\nr'(?:id|ID)=(?P<id>\\d+)'\nIncorrect:\nr'(id|ID)=(?P<id>\\d+)'\nMake regular expressions relaxed and flexible\nWhen using regular expressions try to write them fuzzy, relaxed and flexible, skipping insignificant parts that are more likely to change, allowing both single and double quotes for quoted values and so on.\nExample\nSay you need to extract title from the following HTML code:\n<span style=\"position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;\" class=\"title\">some fancy title<\/span>\nThe code for that task should look similar to:\ntitle = self._search_regex(\n    r'<span[^>]+class=\"title\"[^>]*>([^<]+)', webpage, 'title')\nOr even better:\ntitle = self._search_regex(\n    r'<span[^>]+class=([\"\\'])title\\1[^>]*>(?P<title>[^<]+)',\n    webpage, 'title', group='title')\nNote how you tolerate potential changes in the style attribute's value or switch from using double quotes to single for class attribute:\nThe code definitely should not look like:\ntitle = self._search_regex(\n    r'<span style=\"position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;\" class=\"title\">(.*?)<\/span>',\n    webpage, 'title', group='title')\nLong lines policy\nThere is a soft limit to keep lines of code under 80 characters long. This means it should be respected if possible and if it does not make readability and code maintenance worse.\nFor example, you should never split long string literals like URLs or some other often copied entities over multiple lines to fit this limit:\nCorrect:\n'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&list=PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'\nIncorrect:\n'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&list='\n'PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'\nInline values\nExtracting variables is acceptable for reducing code duplication and improving readability of complex expressions. However, you should avoid extracting variables used only once and moving them to opposite parts of the extractor file, which makes reading the linear flow difficult.\nExample\nCorrect:\ntitle = self._html_search_regex(r'<title>([^<]+)<\/title>', webpage, 'title')\nIncorrect:\nTITLE_RE = r'<title>([^<]+)<\/title>'\n# ...some lines of code...\ntitle = self._html_search_regex(TITLE_RE, webpage, 'title')\nCollapse fallbacks\nMultiple fallback values can quickly become unwieldy. Collapse multiple fallback values into a single expression via a list of patterns.\nExample\nGood:\ndescription = self._html_search_meta(\n    ['og:description', 'description', 'twitter:description'],\n    webpage, 'description', default=None)\nUnwieldy:\ndescription = (\n    self._og_search_description(webpage, default=None)\n    or self._html_search_meta('description', webpage, default=None)\n    or self._html_search_meta('twitter:description', webpage, default=None))\nMethods supporting list of patterns are: _search_regex, _html_search_regex, _og_search_property, _html_search_meta.\nTrailing parentheses\nAlways move trailing parentheses after the last argument.\nExample\nCorrect:\n    lambda x: x['ResultSet']['Result'][0]['VideoUrlSet']['VideoUrl'],\n    list)\nIncorrect:\n    lambda x: x['ResultSet']['Result'][0]['VideoUrlSet']['VideoUrl'],\n    list,\n)\nUse convenience conversion and parsing functions\nWrap all extracted numeric data into safe functions from youtube_dl\/utils.py: int_or_none, float_or_none. Use them for string to number conversions as well.\nUse url_or_none for safe URL processing.\nUse try_get for safe metadata extraction from parsed JSON.\nUse unified_strdate for uniform upload_date or any YYYYMMDD meta field extraction, unified_timestamp for uniform timestamp extraction, parse_filesize for filesize extraction, parse_count for count meta fields extraction, parse_resolution, parse_duration for duration extraction, parse_age_limit for age_limit extraction.\nExplore youtube_dl\/utils.py for more useful convenience functions.\nMore examples\nSafely extract optional description from parsed JSON\ndescription = try_get(response, lambda x: x['result']['video'][0]['summary'], compat_str)\nSafely extract more optional metadata\nvideo = try_get(response, lambda x: x['result']['video'][0], dict) or {}\ndescription = video.get('summary')\nduration = float_or_none(video.get('durationMs'), scale=1000)\nview_count = int_or_none(video.get('views'))\nEMBEDDING YOUTUBE-DL\nyoutube-dl makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language. If you encounter any problems parsing its output, feel free to create a report.\nFrom a Python program, you can embed youtube-dl in a more powerful fashion, like this:\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nimport youtube_dl\n\nydl_opts = {}\nwith youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:\n    ydl.download(['https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])\nMost likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at youtube_dl\/YoutubeDL.py. For a start, if you want to intercept youtube-dl's output, set a logger object.\nHere's a more complete example of a program that outputs only errors (and a short message after the download is finished), and downloads\/converts the video to an mp3 file:\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nimport youtube_dl\n\n\nclass MyLogger(object):\n    def debug(self, msg):\n        pass\n\n    def warning(self, msg):\n        pass\n\n    def error(self, msg):\n        print(msg)\n\n\ndef my_hook(d):\n    if d['status'] == 'finished':\n        print('Done downloading, now converting ...')\n\n\nydl_opts = {\n    'format': 'bestaudio\/best',\n    'postprocessors': [{\n        'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',\n        'preferredcodec': 'mp3',\n        'preferredquality': '192',\n    }],\n    'logger': MyLogger(),\n    'progress_hooks': [my_hook],\n}\nwith youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:\n    ydl.download(['https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])\nBUGS\nBugs and suggestions should be reported at: https:\/\/github.com\/ytdl-org\/youtube-dl\/issues. Unless you were prompted to or there is another pertinent reason (e.g. GitHub fails to accept the bug report), please do not send bug reports via personal email. For discussions, join us in the IRC channel #youtube-dl on freenode (webchat).\nPlease include the full output of youtube-dl when run with -v, i.e. add -v flag to your command line, copy the whole output and post it in the issue body wrapped in ``` for better formatting. It should look similar to this:\n$ youtube-dl -v <your command line>\n[debug] System config: []\n[debug] User config: []\n[debug] Command-line args: [u'-v', u'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BaW_jenozKcj']\n[debug] Encodings: locale cp1251, fs mbcs, out cp866, pref cp1251\n[debug] youtube-dl version 2015.12.06\n[debug] Git HEAD: 135392e\n[debug] Python version 2.6.6 - Windows-2003Server-5.2.3790-SP2\n[debug] exe versions: ffmpeg N-75573-g1d0487f, ffprobe N-75573-g1d0487f, rtmpdump 2.4\n[debug] Proxy map: {}\n...\n\nDo not post screenshots of verbose logs; only plain text is acceptable.\nThe output (including the first lines) contains important debugging information. Issues without the full output are often not reproducible and therefore do not get solved in short order, if ever.\nPlease re-read your issue once again to avoid a couple of common mistakes (you can and should use this as a checklist):\nIs the description of the issue itself sufficient?\nWe often get issue reports that we cannot really decipher. While in most cases we eventually get the required information after asking back multiple times, this poses an unnecessary drain on our resources. Many contributors, including myself, are also not native speakers, so we may misread some parts.\nSo please elaborate on what feature you are requesting, or what bug you want to be fixed. Make sure that it's obvious\n\nWhat the problem is\nHow it could be fixed\nHow your proposed solution would look like\n\nIf your report is shorter than two lines, it is almost certainly missing some of these, which makes it hard for us to respond to it. We're often too polite to close the issue outright, but the missing info makes misinterpretation likely. As a committer myself, I often get frustrated by these issues, since the only possible way for me to move forward on them is to ask for clarification over and over.\nFor bug reports, this means that your report should contain the complete output of youtube-dl when called with the -v flag. The error message you get for (most) bugs even says so, but you would not believe how many of our bug reports do not contain this information.\nIf your server has multiple IPs or you suspect censorship, adding --call-home may be a good idea to get more diagnostics. If the error is ERROR: Unable to extract ... and you cannot reproduce it from multiple countries, add --dump-pages (warning: this will yield a rather large output, redirect it to the file log.txt by adding >log.txt 2>&1 to your command-line) or upload the .dump files you get when you add --write-pages somewhere.\nSite support requests must contain an example URL. An example URL is a URL you might want to download, like https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc. There should be an obvious video present. Except under very special circumstances, the main page of a video service (e.g. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/) is not an example URL.\nAre you using the latest version?\nBefore reporting any issue, type youtube-dl -U. This should report that you're up-to-date. About 20% of the reports we receive are already fixed, but people are using outdated versions. This goes for feature requests as well.\nIs the issue already documented?\nMake sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying to open. Search at the top of the window or browse the GitHub Issues of this repository. If there is an issue, feel free to write something along the lines of \"This affects me as well, with version 2015.01.01. Here is some more information on the issue: ...\". While some issues may be old, a new post into them often spurs rapid activity.\nWhy are existing options not enough?\nBefore requesting a new feature, please have a quick peek at the list of supported options. Many feature requests are for features that actually exist already! Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue report and detail how the existing similar options do not solve your problem.\nIs there enough context in your bug report?\nPeople want to solve problems, and often think they do us a favor by breaking down their larger problems (e.g. wanting to skip already downloaded files) to a specific request (e.g. requesting us to look whether the file exists before downloading the info page). However, what often happens is that they break down the problem into two steps: One simple, and one impossible (or extremely complicated one).\nWe are then presented with a very complicated request when the original problem could be solved far easier, e.g. by recording the downloaded video IDs in a separate file. To avoid this, you must include the greater context where it is non-obvious. In particular, every feature request that does not consist of adding support for a new site should contain a use case scenario that explains in what situation the missing feature would be useful.\nDoes the issue involve one problem, and one problem only?\nSome of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or should open. There is no limit of issues they can or should open. While it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one ticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot mark the issue as closed. Typically, reporting a bunch of issues leads to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth, until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.\nIn particular, every site support request issue should only pertain to services at one site (generally under a common domain, but always using the same backend technology). Do not request support for vimeo user videos, White house podcasts, and Google Plus pages in the same issue. Also, make sure that you don't post bug reports alongside feature requests. As a rule of thumb, a feature request does not include outputs of youtube-dl that are not immediately related to the feature at hand. Do not post reports of a network error alongside the request for a new video service.\nIs anyone going to need the feature?\nOnly post features that you (or an incapacitated friend you can personally talk to) require. Do not post features because they seem like a good idea. If they are really useful, they will be requested by someone who requires them.\nIs your question about youtube-dl?\nIt may sound strange, but some bug reports we receive are completely unrelated to youtube-dl and relate to a different, or even the reporter's own, application. Please make sure that you are actually using youtube-dl. If you are using a UI for youtube-dl, report the bug to the maintainer of the actual application providing the UI. On the other hand, if your UI for youtube-dl fails in some way you believe is related to youtube-dl, by all means, go ahead and report the bug.\nCOPYRIGHT\nyoutube-dl is released into the public domain by the copyright holders.\nThis README file was originally written by Daniel Bolton and is likewise released into the public domain.\n","126":"\nWelcome to the Model Garden for TensorFlow\nThe TensorFlow Model Garden is a repository with a number of different implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modeling solutions for TensorFlow users.

httpie.org\/docs,\nwhere you can select your corresponding HTTPie version as well as run examples directly from the\nbrowser using a termible.io embedded terminal.\nIf you are reading this on GitHub, then this text covers the current development version.\nYou are invited to submit fixes and improvements to the the docs by editing\nREADME.rst.\n\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Main features\n\nExpressive and intuitive syntax\nFormatted and colorized terminal output\nBuilt-in JSON support\nForms and file uploads\nHTTPS, proxies, and authentication\nArbitrary request data\nCustom headers\nPersistent sessions\nWget-like downloads\nLinux, macOS and Windows support\nPlugins\nDocumentation\nTest coverage\n\n\n\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Installation\n\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0macOS\nOn macOS, HTTPie can be installed via Homebrew\n(recommended):\n$ brew install httpie\nA MacPorts port is also available:\n$ port install httpie\n\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linux\nMost Linux distributions provide a package that can be installed using the\nsystem package manager, for example:\n# Debian, Ubuntu, etc.\n$ apt install httpie\n# Fedora\n$ dnf install httpie\n# CentOS, RHEL, ...\n$ yum install httpie\n# Gentoo\n$ emerge httpie\n# Arch Linux\n$ pacman -S httpie\n\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Windows, etc.\nA universal installation method (that works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, \u2026,\nand always provides the latest version) is to use pip:\n# Make sure we have an up-to-date version of pip and setuptools:\n$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n\n$ pip install --upgrade httpie\n(If pip installation fails for some reason, you can try\neasy_install httpie as a fallback.)\n\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Python version\nPython version 3.6 or greater is required.\n\n3.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unstable version\nYou can also install the latest unreleased development version directly from\nthe master branch on GitHub.  It is a work-in-progress of a future stable\nrelease so the experience might be not as smooth.\n\n\nOn macOS you can install it with Homebrew:\n$ brew uninstall --force httpie\n$ brew install --HEAD httpie\nOtherwise with pip:\n$ pip install --upgrade https:\/\/github.com\/httpie\/httpie\/archive\/master.tar.gz\nVerify that now we have the\ncurrent development version identifier\nwith the -dev suffix, for example:\n$ http --version\n# 2.0.0-dev\n\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Usage\nHello World:\n$ https httpie.io\/hello\nSynopsis:\n$ http [flags] [METHOD] URL [ITEM [ITEM]]\nSee also http --help.\n\n4.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Examples\nCustom HTTP method, HTTP headers and JSON data:\n$ http PUT httpbin.org\/put X-API-Token:123 name=John\nSubmitting forms:\n$ http -f POST httpbin.org\/post hello=World\nSee the request that is being sent using one of the output options:\n$ http -v httpbin.org\/get\nBuild and print a request without sending it using offline mode:\n$ http --offline httpbin.org\/post hello=offline\nUse GitHub API to post a comment on an\nissue\nwith authentication:\n$ http -a USERNAME POST https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/httpie\/httpie\/issues\/83\/comments body='HTTPie is awesome! :heart:'\nUpload a file using redirected input:\n$ http httpbin.org\/post < files\/data.json\nDownload a file and save it via redirected output:\n$ http httpbin.org\/image\/png > image.png\nDownload a file wget style:\n$ http --download httpbin.org\/image\/png\nUse named sessions to make certain aspects of the communication persistent\nbetween requests to the same host:\n$ http --session=logged-in -a username:password httpbin.org\/get API-Key:123\n$ http --session=logged-in httpbin.org\/headers\nSet a custom Host header to work around missing DNS records:\n$ http localhost:8000 Host:example.com\n\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HTTP method\nThe name of the HTTP method comes right before the URL argument:\n$ http DELETE httpbin.org\/delete\nWhich looks similar to the actual Request-Line that is sent:\nDELETE \/delete HTTP\/1.1\nWhen the METHOD argument is omitted from the command, HTTPie defaults to\neither GET (with no request data) or POST (with request data).\n\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Request URL\nThe only information HTTPie needs to perform a request is a URL.\nThe default scheme is http:\/\/ and can be omitted from the argument:\n$ http example.org\n# => http:\/\/example.org\nHTTPie also installs an https executable, where the default\nscheme is https:\/\/:\n$ https example.org\n# => https:\/\/example.org\n\n6.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Querystring parameters\nIf you find yourself manually constructing URLs with querystring parameters\non the terminal, you may appreciate the param==value syntax for appending\nURL parameters.\nWith that, you don\u2019t have to worry about escaping the &\nseparators for your shell. Additionally, any special characters in the\nparameter name or value get automatically URL-escaped\n(as opposed to parameters specified in the full URL, which HTTPie doesn\u2019t\nmodify).\n$ http https:\/\/api.github.com\/search\/repositories q==httpie per_page==1\nGET \/search\/repositories?q=httpie&per_page=1 HTTP\/1.1\n\n6.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0URL shortcuts for localhost\nAdditionally, curl-like shorthand for localhost is supported.\nThis means that, for example :3000 would expand to http:\/\/localhost:3000\nIf the port is omitted, then port 80 is assumed.\n$ http :\/foo\nGET \/foo HTTP\/1.1\nHost: localhost\n$ http :3000\/bar\nGET \/bar HTTP\/1.1\nHost: localhost:3000\n$ http :\nGET \/ HTTP\/1.1\nHost: localhost\n\n6.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other default schemes\nWhen HTTPie is invoked as https then the default scheme is https:\/\/\n($ https example.org will make a request to https:\/\/example.org).\nYou can also use the --default-scheme <URL_SCHEME> option to create\nshortcuts for other protocols than HTTP (possibly supported via plugins).\nExample for the httpie-unixsocket plugin:\n# Before\n$ http http+unix:\/\/%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock\/info\n# Create an alias\n$ alias http-unix='http --default-scheme=\"http+unix\"'\n# Now the scheme can be omitted\n$ http-unix %2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock\/info\n\n6.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--path-as-is\nThe standard behaviour of HTTP clients is to normalize the path portion of URLs by squashing dot segments\nas a typically filesystem would:\n$ http -v example.org\/.\/..\/..\/etc\/password\nGET \/etc\/password HTTP\/1.1\nThe --path-as-is option allows you to disable this behavior:\n$ http --path-as-is -v example.org\/.\/..\/..\/etc\/password\nGET \/..\/..\/etc\/password HTTP\/1.1\n\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Request items\nThere are a few different request item types that provide a\nconvenient mechanism for specifying HTTP headers, simple JSON and\nform data, files, and URL parameters.\nThey are key\/value pairs specified after the URL. All have in\ncommon that they become part of the actual request that is sent and that\ntheir type is distinguished only by the separator used:\n:, =, :=, ==, @, =@, and :=@. The ones with an\n@ expect a file path as value.\n\n\nItem Type\nDescription\n\n\n\nHTTP Headers\nName:Value\nArbitrary HTTP header, e.g. X-API-Token:123.\n\nURL parameters\nname==value\nAppends the given name\/value pair as a query\nstring parameter to the URL.\nThe == separator is used.\n\nData Fields\nfield=value,\nfield=@file.txt\nRequest data fields to be serialized as a JSON\nobject (default), to be form-encoded\n(with --form, -f), or to be serialized as\nmultipart\/form-data (with --multipart).\n\nRaw JSON fields\nfield:=json,\nfield:=@file.json\nUseful when sending JSON and one or\nmore fields need to be a Boolean, Number,\nnested Object, or an Array,  e.g.,\nmeals:='[\"ham\",\"spam\"]' or pies:=[1,2,3]\n(note the quotes).\n\nFields upload fields\nfield@\/dir\/file\nfield@file;type\nOnly available with --form, -f and\n--multipart.\nFor example screenshot@~\/Pictures\/img.png, or\n'cv@cv.txt;text\/markdown'.\nWith --form, the presence of a file field\nresults in a --multipart request.\n\n\n\nNote that data fields aren\u2019t the only way to specify request data:\nRedirected input is a mechanism for passing arbitrary request data.\n\n7.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Escaping rules\nYou can use \\ to escape characters that shouldn\u2019t be used as separators\n(or parts thereof). For instance, foo\\==bar will become a data key\/value\npair (foo= and bar) instead of a URL parameter.\nOften it is necessary to quote the values, e.g. foo='bar baz'.\nIf any of the field names or headers starts with a minus\n(e.g., -fieldname), you need to place all such items after the special\ntoken -- to prevent confusion with --arguments:\n$ http httpbin.org\/post  --  -name-starting-with-dash=foo -Unusual-Header:bar\nPOST \/post HTTP\/1.1\n-Unusual-Header: bar\nContent-Type: application\/json\n\n{\n    \"-name-starting-with-dash\": \"foo\"\n}\n\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0JSON\nJSON is the lingua franca of modern web services and it is also the\nimplicit content type HTTPie uses by default.\nSimple example:\n$ http PUT httpbin.org\/put name=John email=john@example.org\nPUT \/ HTTP\/1.1\nAccept: application\/json, *\/*;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nContent-Type: application\/json\nHost: httpbin.org\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"email\": \"john@example.org\"\n}\n\n8.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Default behaviour\nIf your command includes some data request items, they are serialized as a JSON\nobject by default. HTTPie also automatically sets the following headers,\nboth of which can be overwritten:\n\n\nContent-Type\napplication\/json\n\nAccept\napplication\/json, *\/*;q=0.5\n\n\n\n\n8.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explicit JSON\nYou can use --json, -j to explicitly set Accept\nto application\/json regardless of whether you are sending data\n(it\u2019s a shortcut for setting the header via the usual header notation:\nhttp url Accept:'application\/json, *\/*;q=0.5'). Additionally,\nHTTPie will try to detect JSON responses even when the\nContent-Type is incorrectly text\/plain or unknown.\n\n8.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-string JSON fields\nNon-string JSON fields use the := separator, which allows you to embed arbitrary JSON data\ninto the resulting JSON object. Additionally, text and raw JSON files can also be embedded into\nfields using =@ and :=@:\n$ http PUT httpbin.org\/put \\\n    name=John \\                        # String (default)\n    age:=29 \\                          # Raw JSON \u2014 Number\n    married:=false \\                   # Raw JSON \u2014 Boolean\n    hobbies:='[\"http\", \"pies\"]' \\      # Raw JSON \u2014 Array\n    favorite:='{\"tool\": \"HTTPie\"}' \\   # Raw JSON \u2014 Object\n    bookmarks:=@files\/data.json \\      # Embed JSON file\n    description=@files\/text.txt        # Embed text file\nPUT \/person\/1 HTTP\/1.1\nAccept: application\/json, *\/*;q=0.5\nContent-Type: application\/json\nHost: httpbin.org\n\n{\n    \"age\": 29,\n    \"hobbies\": [\n        \"http\",\n        \"pies\"\n    ],\n    \"description\": \"John is a nice guy who likes pies.\",\n    \"married\": false,\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"favorite\": {\n        \"tool\": \"HTTPie\"\n    },\n    \"bookmarks\": {\n        \"HTTPie\": \"https:\/\/httpie.org\",\n    }\n}\n\n8.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw and complex JSON\nPlease note that with the request items data field syntax, commands\ncan quickly become unwieldy when sending complex structures.\nIn such cases, it\u2019s better to pass the full raw JSON data via\nredirected input, for example:\n$ echo '{\"hello\": \"world\"}' | http POST httpbin.org\/post\n$ http POST httpbin.org\/post < files\/data.json\nFurthermore, this syntax only allows you to send an object as the JSON document, but not an array, etc.\nHere, again, the solution is to use redirected input.\n\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forms\nSubmitting forms is very similar to sending JSON requests. Often the only\ndifference is in adding the --form, -f option, which ensures that\ndata fields are serialized as, and Content-Type is set to,\napplication\/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8. It is possible to make\nform data the implicit content type instead of JSON\nvia the config file.\n\n9.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regular forms\n$ http --form POST httpbin.org\/post name='John Smith'\nPOST \/post HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8\n\nname=John+Smith\n\n9.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0File upload forms\nIf one or more file fields is present, the serialization and content type is\nmultipart\/form-data:\n$ http -f POST httpbin.org\/post name='John Smith' cv@~\/files\/data.xml\nThe request above is the same as if the following HTML form were\nsubmitted:\n<form enctype=\"multipart\/form-data\" method=\"post\" action=\"http:\/\/example.com\/jobs\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" \/>\n    <input type=\"file\" name=\"cv\" \/>\n<\/form>\nPlease note that @ is used to simulate a file upload form field, whereas\n=@ just embeds the file content as a regular text field value.\nWhen uploading files, their content type is inferred from the file name. You can manually\noverride the inferred content type:\n$ http -f POST httpbin.org\/post name='John Smith' cv@'~\/files\/data.bin;type=application\/pdf'\nTo perform a multipart\/form-data request even without any files, use\n--multipart instead of --form:\n$ http --multipart --offline example.org hello=world\nPOST \/ HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Length: 129\nContent-Type: multipart\/form-data; boundary=c31279ab254f40aeb06df32b433cbccb\nHost: example.org\n\n--c31279ab254f40aeb06df32b433cbccb\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"hello\"\n\nworld\n--c31279ab254f40aeb06df32b433cbccb--\nFile uploads are always streamed to avoid memory issues with large files.\nBy default, HTTPie uses a random unique string as the multipart boundary\nbut you can use --boundary to specify a custom string instead:\n$ http --form --multipart --boundary=xoxo --offline example.org hello=world\nPOST \/ HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Length: 129\nContent-Type: multipart\/form-data; boundary=xoxo\nHost: example.org\n\n--xoxo\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"hello\"\n\nworld\n--xoxo--\nIf you specify a custom Content-Type header without including the boundary\nbit, HTTPie will add the boundary value (explicitly specified or auto-generated)\nto the header automatically:\nhttp --form --multipart --offline example.org hello=world Content-Type:multipart\/letter\nPOST \/ HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Length: 129\nContent-Type: multipart\/letter; boundary=c31279ab254f40aeb06df32b433cbccb\nHost: example.org\n\n--c31279ab254f40aeb06df32b433cbccb\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"hello\"\n\nworld\n--c31279ab254f40aeb06df32b433cbccb--\n\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HTTP headers\nTo set custom headers you can use the Header:Value notation:\n$ http httpbin.org\/headers  User-Agent:Bacon\/1.0  'Cookie:valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar'  \\\n    X-Foo:Bar  Referer:https:\/\/httpie.org\/\nGET \/headers HTTP\/1.1\nAccept: *\/*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nCookie: valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar\nHost: httpbin.org\nReferer: https:\/\/httpie.org\/\nUser-Agent: Bacon\/1.0\nX-Foo: Bar\n\n10.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Default request headers\nThere are a couple of default headers that HTTPie sets:\nGET \/ HTTP\/1.1\nAccept: *\/*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: HTTPie\/<version>\nHost: <taken-from-URL>\nAny of these can be overwritten and some of them unset (see bellow).\n\n10.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Empty headers and header un-setting\nTo unset a previously specified header\n(such a one of the default headers), use Header::\n$ http httpbin.org\/headers Accept: User-Agent:\nTo send a header with an empty value, use Header;:\n$ http httpbin.org\/headers 'Header;'\n\n10.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Limiting response headers\nThe --max-headers=n options allows you to control the number of headers\nHTTPie reads before giving up (the default 0, i.e., there\u2019s no limit).\n$ http --max-headers=100 httpbin.org\/get\n\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offline mode\nUse --offline to construct HTTP requests without sending them anywhere.\nWith --offline, HTTPie builds a request based on the specified options and arguments, prints it to stdout,\nand then exits. It works completely offline; no network connection is ever made.\nThis has a number of use cases, including:\nGenerating API documentation examples that you can copy & paste without sending a request:\n$ http --offline POST server.chess\/api\/games API-Key:ZZZ w=magnus b=hikaru t=180 i=2\n$ http --offline MOVE server.chess\/api\/games\/123 API-Key:ZZZ p=b a=R1a3 t=77\nGenerating raw requests that can be sent with any other client:\n# 1. save a raw request to a file:\n$ http --offline POST httpbin.org\/post hello=world > request.http\n# 2. send it over the wire with, for example, the fantastic netcat tool:\n$ nc httpbin.org 80 < request.http\nYou can also use the --offline mode for debugging and exploring HTTP and HTTPie, and for \u201cdry runs\u201d.\n--offline has the side-effect of automatically activating --print=HB, i.e., both the request headers and the body\nare printed. You can customize the output with the usual output options, with the exception that there\nis not response to be printed. You can use --offline in combination with all the other options (e.g., --session).\n\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cookies\nHTTP clients send cookies to the server as regular HTTP headers. That means,\nHTTPie does not offer any special syntax for specifying cookies \u2014 the usual\nHeader:Value notation is used:\nSend a single cookie:\n$ http httpbin.org\/cookies Cookie:sessionid=foo\nGET \/ HTTP\/1.1\nAccept: *\/*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nConnection: keep-alive\nCookie: sessionid=foo\nHost: httpbin.org\nUser-Agent: HTTPie\/0.9.9\nSend multiple cookies\n(note the header is quoted to prevent the shell from interpreting the ;):\n$ http httpbin.org\/cookies 'Cookie:sessionid=foo;another-cookie=bar'\nGET \/ HTTP\/1.1\nAccept: *\/*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nConnection: keep-alive\nCookie: sessionid=foo;another-cookie=bar\nHost: httpbin.org\nUser-Agent: HTTPie\/0.9.9\nIf you often deal with cookies in your requests, then chances are you\u2019d appreciate\nthe sessions feature.\n\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authentication\nThe currently supported authentication schemes are Basic and Digest\n(see auth plugins for more). There are two flags that control authentication:\n\n\n--auth, -a\nPass a username:password pair as\nthe argument. Or, if you only specify a username\n(-a username), you\u2019ll be prompted for\nthe password before the request is sent.\nTo send an empty password, pass username:.\nThe username:password@hostname URL syntax is\nsupported as well (but credentials passed via -a\nhave higher priority).\n\n--auth-type, -A\nSpecify the auth mechanism. Possible values are\nbasic, digest, or the name of any auth plugins you have installed. The default value is\nbasic so it can often be omitted.\n\n\n\n\n13.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Basic auth\n$ http -a username:password httpbin.org\/basic-auth\/username\/password\n\n13.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Digest auth\n$ http -A digest -a username:password httpbin.org\/digest-auth\/httpie\/username\/password\n\n13.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Password prompt\n$ http -a username httpbin.org\/basic-auth\/username\/password\n\n13.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Empty password\n$ http -a username: httpbin.org\/headers\n\n13.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.netrc\nAuthentication information from your ~\/.netrc\nfile is by default honored as well.\nFor example:\n$ cat ~\/.netrc\nmachine httpbin.org\nlogin httpie\npassword test\n$ http httpbin.org\/basic-auth\/httpie\/test\nHTTP\/1.1 200 OK\n[...]\nThis can be disabled with the --ignore-netrc option:\n$ http --ignore-netrc httpbin.org\/basic-auth\/httpie\/test\nHTTP\/1.1 401 UNAUTHORIZED\n[...]\n\n13.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Auth plugins\nAdditional authentication mechanism can be installed as plugins.\nThey can be found on the Python Package Index.\nHere\u2019s a few picks:\n\nhttpie-api-auth: ApiAuth\nhttpie-aws-auth: AWS \/ Amazon S3\nhttpie-edgegrid: EdgeGrid\nhttpie-hmac-auth: HMAC\nhttpie-jwt-auth: JWTAuth (JSON Web Tokens)\nhttpie-negotiate: SPNEGO (GSS Negotiate)\nhttpie-ntlm: NTLM (NT LAN Manager)\nhttpie-oauth: OAuth\nrequests-hawk: Hawk\n\n\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HTTP redirects\nBy default, HTTP redirects are not followed and only the first\nresponse is shown:\n$ http httpbin.org\/redirect\/3\n\n14.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Follow Location\nTo instruct HTTPie to follow the Location header of 30x responses\nand show the final response instead, use the --follow, -F option:\n$ http --follow httpbin.org\/redirect\/3\n\n14.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Showing intermediary redirect responses\nIf you additionally wish to see the intermediary requests\/responses,\nthen use the --all option as well:\n$ http --follow --all httpbin.org\/redirect\/3\n\n14.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Limiting maximum redirects followed\nTo change the default limit of maximum 30 redirects, use the\n--max-redirects=<limit> option:\n$ http --follow --all --max-redirects=2 httpbin.org\/redirect\/3\n\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proxies\nYou can specify proxies to be used through the --proxy argument for each\nprotocol (which is included in the value in case of redirects across protocols):\n$ http --proxy=http:http:\/\/10.10.1.10:3128 --proxy=https:https:\/\/10.10.1.10:1080 example.org\nWith Basic authentication:\n$ http --proxy=http:http:\/\/user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128 example.org\n\n15.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Environment variables\nYou can also configure proxies by environment variables ALL_PROXY,\nHTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY, and the underlying Requests library will\npick them up as well. If you want to disable proxies configured through\nthe environment variables for certain hosts, you can specify them in NO_PROXY.\nIn your ~\/.bash_profile:\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http:\/\/10.10.1.10:3128\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=https:\/\/10.10.1.10:1080\nexport NO_PROXY=localhost,example.com\n\n15.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SOCKS\nUsage is the same as for other types of proxies:\n$ http --proxy=http:socks5:\/\/user:pass@host:port --proxy=https:socks5:\/\/user:pass@host:port example.org\n\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HTTPS\n\n16.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Server SSL certificate verification\nTo skip the host\u2019s SSL certificate verification, you can pass --verify=no\n(default is yes):\n$ http --verify=no https:\/\/httpbin.org\/get\n\n16.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Custom CA bundle\nYou can also use --verify=<CA_BUNDLE_PATH> to set a custom CA bundle path:\n$ http --verify=\/ssl\/custom_ca_bundle https:\/\/example.org\n\n16.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Client side SSL certificate\nTo use a client side certificate for the SSL communication, you can pass\nthe path of the cert file with --cert:\n$ http --cert=client.pem https:\/\/example.org\nIf the private key is not contained in the cert file you may pass the\npath of the key file with --cert-key:\n$ http --cert=client.crt --cert-key=client.key https:\/\/example.org\n\n16.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SSL version\nUse the --ssl=<PROTOCOL> option to specify the desired protocol version to\nuse. This will default to SSL v2.3 which will negotiate the highest protocol\nthat both the server and your installation of OpenSSL support. The available\nprotocols are\nssl2.3, ssl3, tls1, tls1.1, tls1.2, tls1.3.\n(The actually available set of protocols may vary depending on your OpenSSL\ninstallation.)\n# Specify the vulnerable SSL v3 protocol to talk to an outdated server:\n$ http --ssl=ssl3 https:\/\/vulnerable.example.org\n\n16.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SSL ciphers\nYou can specify the available ciphers with --ciphers.\nIt should be a string in the\nOpenSSL cipher list format.\n$ http --ciphers=ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256  https:\/\/httpbin.org\/get\nNote: these cipher strings do not change the negotiated version of SSL or TLS,\nthey only affect the list of available cipher suites.\nTo see the default cipher string, run http --help and see\nthe --ciphers section under SSL.\n\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Output options\nBy default, HTTPie only outputs the final response and the whole response\nmessage is printed (headers as well as the body). You can control what should\nbe printed via several options:\n\n\n--headers, -h\nOnly the response headers are printed.\n\n--body, -b\nOnly the response body is printed.\n\n--verbose, -v\nPrint the whole HTTP exchange (request and response).\nThis option also enables --all (see below).\n\n--print, -p\nSelects parts of the HTTP exchange.\n\n--quiet, -q\nDon't print anything to stdout and stderr.\n\n\n\n\n17.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What parts of the HTTP exchange should be printed\nAll the other output options are under the hood just shortcuts for\nthe more powerful --print, -p. It accepts a string of characters each\nof which represents a specific part of the HTTP exchange:\n\n\nCharacter\nStands for\n\n\n\nH\nrequest headers\n\nB\nrequest body\n\nh\nresponse headers\n\nb\nresponse body\n\n\n\nPrint request and response headers:\n$ http --print=Hh PUT httpbin.org\/put hello=world\n\n17.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verbose output\n--verbose can often be useful for debugging the request and generating\ndocumentation examples:\n$ http --verbose PUT httpbin.org\/put hello=world\nPUT \/put HTTP\/1.1\nAccept: application\/json, *\/*;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nContent-Type: application\/json\nHost: httpbin.org\nUser-Agent: HTTPie\/0.2.7dev\n\n{\n    \"hello\": \"world\"\n}\n\n\nHTTP\/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 477\nContent-Type: application\/json\nDate: Sun, 05 Aug 2012 00:25:23 GMT\nServer: gunicorn\/0.13.4\n\n{\n    [\u2026]\n}\n\n17.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quiet output\n--quiet redirects all output that would otherwise go to stdout\nand stderr  (except for error messages) to \/dev\/null.\nThis doesn\u2019t affect output to a file via --output or --download.\n# There will be no output:\n$ http --quiet httpbin.org\/post enjoy='the silence'\n\n17.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viewing intermediary requests\/responses\nTo see all the HTTP communication, i.e. the final request\/response as\nwell as any possible  intermediary requests\/responses, use the --all\noption. The intermediary HTTP communication include followed redirects\n(with --follow), the first unauthorized request when HTTP digest\nauthentication is used (--auth=digest), etc.\n# Include all responses that lead to the final one:\n$ http --all --follow httpbin.org\/redirect\/3\nThe intermediary requests\/response are by default formatted according to\n--print, -p (and its shortcuts described above). If you\u2019d like to change\nthat, use the --history-print, -P option. It takes the same\narguments as --print, -p but applies to the intermediary requests only.\n# Print the intermediary requests\/responses differently than the final one:\n$ http -A digest -a foo:bar --all -p Hh -P H httpbin.org\/digest-auth\/auth\/foo\/bar\n\n17.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conditional body download\nAs an optimization, the response body is downloaded from the server\nonly if it\u2019s part of the output. This is similar to performing a HEAD\nrequest, except that it applies to any HTTP method you use.\nLet\u2019s say that there is an API that returns the whole resource when it is\nupdated, but you are only interested in the response headers to see the\nstatus code after an update:\n$ http --headers PATCH httpbin.org\/patch name='New Name'\nSince we are only printing the HTTP headers here, the connection to the server\nis closed as soon as all the response headers have been received.\nTherefore, bandwidth and time isn\u2019t wasted downloading the body\nwhich you don\u2019t care about. The response headers are downloaded always,\neven if they are not part of the output\n\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Redirected Input\nThe universal method for passing request data is through redirected stdin\n(standard input)\u2014piping.\nBy default, stdin data is buffered and then with no further processing\nused as the request body. If you provide Content-Length, then the request\nbody is streamed without buffering. You can also use --chunked to enable\nstreaming via chunked transfer encoding.\nThere are multiple useful ways to use piping:\nRedirect from a file:\n$ http PUT httpbin.org\/put X-API-Token:123 < files\/data.json\nOr the output of another program:\n$ grep '401 Unauthorized' \/var\/log\/httpd\/error_log | http POST httpbin.org\/post\nYou can use echo for simple data:\n$ echo '{\"name\": \"John\"}' | http PATCH httpbin.org\/patch X-API-Token:123\nYou can also use a Bash here string:\n$ http httpbin.org\/post <<<'{\"name\": \"John\"}'\nYou can even pipe web services together using HTTPie:\n$ http GET https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/httpie\/httpie | http POST httpbin.org\/post\nYou can use cat to enter multiline data on the terminal:\n$ cat | http POST httpbin.org\/post\n<paste>\n^D\n$ cat | http POST httpbin.org\/post Content-Type:text\/plain\n- buy milk\n- call parents\n^D\nOn OS X, you can send the contents of the clipboard with pbpaste:\n$ pbpaste | http PUT httpbin.org\/put\nPassing data through stdin cannot be combined with data fields specified\non the command line:\n$ echo 'data' | http POST example.org more=data   # This is invalid\nTo prevent HTTPie from reading stdin data you can use the\n--ignore-stdin option.\n\n18.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Request data from a filename\nAn alternative to redirected stdin is specifying a filename (as\n@\/path\/to\/file) whose content is used as if it came from stdin.\nIt has the advantage that the Content-Type\nheader is automatically set to the appropriate value based on the\nfilename extension. For example, the following request sends the\nverbatim contents of that XML file with Content-Type: application\/xml:\n$ http PUT httpbin.org\/put @files\/data.xml\nFile uploads are always streamed to avoid memory issues with large files.\n\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chunked transfer encoding\nYou can use the --chunked flag to instruct HTTPie to use\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked:\n$ http --chunked PUT httpbin.org\/put hello=world\n$ http --chunked --multipart PUT httpbin.org\/put hello=world foo@files\/data.xml\n$ http --chunked httpbin.org\/post @files\/data.xml\n$ cat files\/data.xml | http --chunked httpbin.org\/post\n\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terminal output\nHTTPie does several things by default in order to make its terminal output\neasy to read.\n\n20.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colors and formatting\nSyntax highlighting is applied to HTTP headers and bodies (where it makes\nsense). You can choose your preferred color scheme via the --style option\nif you don\u2019t like the default one. There dozens of styles available, here are just a few special or notable ones:\n\n\nauto\nFollows your terminal ANSI color styles. This is the default style used by HTTPie.\n\ndefault\nDefault styles of the underlying Pygments library. Not actually used by default by HTTPie.\nYou can enable it with --style=default\n\nmonokai\nA popular color scheme. Enable with --style=monokai.\n\nfruity\nA bold, colorful scheme. Enable with --style=fruity.\n\n\u2026\nSee $ http --help for all the possible --style values.\n\n\n\nAlso, the following formatting is applied:\n\nHTTP headers are sorted by name.\nJSON data is indented, sorted by keys, and unicode escapes are converted\nto the characters they represent.\n\nOne of these options can be used to control output processing:\n\n\n--pretty=all\nApply both colors and formatting.\nDefault for terminal output.\n\n--pretty=colors\nApply colors.\n\n--pretty=format\nApply formatting.\n\n--pretty=none\nDisables output processing.\nDefault for redirected output.\n\n\n\nYou can control the applied formatting via the --format-options option.\nThe following options are available:\nFor example, this is how you would disable the default header and JSON key\nsorting, and specify a custom JSON indent size:\n$ http --format-options headers.sort:false,json.sort_keys:false,json.indent:2 httpbin.org\/get\nThis is something you will typically store as one of the default options in your\nconfig file. See http --help for all the available formatting options.\nThere are also two shortcuts that allow you to quickly disable and re-enable\nsorting-related format options (currently it means JSON keys and headers):\n--unsorted and --sorted.\n\n20.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Binary data\nBinary data is suppressed for terminal output, which makes it safe to perform\nrequests to URLs that send back binary data. Binary data is suppressed also in\nredirected, but prettified output. The connection is closed as soon as we know\nthat the response body is binary,\n$ http httpbin.org\/bytes\/2000\nYou will nearly instantly see something like this:\nHTTP\/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application\/octet-stream\n\n+-----------------------------------------+\n| NOTE: binary data not shown in terminal |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Redirected output\nHTTPie uses a different set of defaults for redirected output than for\nterminal output. The differences being:\n\nFormatting and colors aren\u2019t applied (unless --pretty is specified).\nOnly the response body is printed (unless one of the output options is set).\nAlso, binary data isn\u2019t suppressed.\n\nThe reason is to make piping HTTPie\u2019s output to another programs and\ndownloading files work with no extra flags. Most of the time, only the raw\nresponse body is of an interest when the output is redirected.\nDownload a file:\n$ http httpbin.org\/image\/png > image.png\nDownload an image of Octocat, resize it using ImageMagick, upload it elsewhere:\n$ http octodex.github.com\/images\/original.jpg | convert - -resize 25% -  | http example.org\/Octocats\nForce colorizing and formatting, and show both the request and the response in\nless pager:\n$ http --pretty=all --verbose httpbin.org\/get | less -R\nThe -R flag tells less to interpret color escape sequences included\nHTTPie`s output.\nYou can create a shortcut for invoking HTTPie with colorized and paged output\nby adding the following to your ~\/.bash_profile:\nfunction httpless {\n    # `httpless example.org'\n    http --pretty=all --print=hb \"$@\" | less -R;\n}\n\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Download mode\nHTTPie features a download mode in which it acts similarly to wget.\nWhen enabled using the --download, -d flag, response headers are printed to\nthe terminal (stderr), and a progress bar is shown while the response body\nis being saved to a file.\n$ http --download https:\/\/github.com\/httpie\/httpie\/archive\/master.tar.gz\nHTTP\/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=httpie-master.tar.gz\nContent-Length: 257336\nContent-Type: application\/x-gzip\n\nDownloading 251.30 kB to \"httpie-master.tar.gz\"\nDone. 251.30 kB in 2.73862s (91.76 kB\/s)\n\n22.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Downloaded filename\nThere are three mutually exclusive ways through which HTTPie determines\nthe output filename (with decreasing priority):\n\nYou can explicitly provide it via --output, -o.\nThe file gets overwritten if it already exists\n(or appended to with --continue, -c).\nThe server may specify the filename in the optional Content-Disposition\nresponse header. Any leading dots are stripped from a server-provided filename.\nThe last resort HTTPie uses is to generate the filename from a combination\nof the request URL and the response Content-Type.\nThe initial URL is always used as the basis for\nthe generated filename \u2014 even if there has been one or more redirects.\n\nTo prevent data loss by overwriting, HTTPie adds a unique numerical suffix to the\nfilename when necessary (unless specified with --output, -o).\n\n22.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Piping while downloading\nYou can also redirect the response body to another program while the response\nheaders and progress are still shown in the terminal:\n$ http -d https:\/\/github.com\/httpie\/httpie\/archive\/master.tar.gz |  tar zxf -\n\n22.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuming downloads\nIf --output, -o is specified, you can resume a partial download using the\n--continue, -c option. This only works with servers that support\nRange requests and 206 Partial Content responses. If the server doesn\u2019t\nsupport that, the whole file will simply be downloaded:\n$ http -dco file.zip example.org\/file\n\n22.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other notes\n\nThe --download option only changes how the response body is treated.\nYou can still set custom headers, use sessions, --verbose, -v, etc.\n--download always implies --follow (redirects are followed).\n--download also implies --check-status\n(error HTTP status will result in a non-zero exist static code).\nHTTPie exits with status code 1 (error) if the body hasn\u2019t been fully\ndownloaded.\nAccept-Encoding cannot be set with --download.\n\n\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Streamed responses\nResponses are downloaded and printed in chunks which allows for streaming\nand large file downloads without using too much memory. However, when\ncolors and formatting is applied, the whole response is buffered and only\nthen processed at once.\n\n23.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disabling buffering\nYou can use the --stream, -S flag to make two things happen:\n\nThe output is flushed in much smaller chunks without any buffering,\nwhich makes HTTPie behave kind of like tail -f for URLs.\nStreaming becomes enabled even when the output is prettified: It will be\napplied to each line of the response and flushed immediately. This makes\nit possible to have a nice output for long-lived requests, such as one\nto the Twitter streaming API.\n\n\n23.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Examples use cases\nPrettified streamed response:\n$ http --stream -f -a YOUR-TWITTER-NAME https:\/\/stream.twitter.com\/1\/statuses\/filter.json track='Justin Bieber'\nStreamed output by small chunks \u00e0 la tail -f:\n# Send each new tweet (JSON object) mentioning \"Apple\" to another\n# server as soon as it arrives from the Twitter streaming API:\n$ http --stream -f -a YOUR-TWITTER-NAME https:\/\/stream.twitter.com\/1\/statuses\/filter.json track=Apple \\\n| while read tweet; do echo \"$tweet\" | http POST example.org\/tweets ; done\n\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sessions\nBy default, every request HTTPie makes is completely independent of any\nprevious ones to the same host.\nHowever, HTTPie also supports persistent\nsessions via the --session=SESSION_NAME_OR_PATH option. In a session,\ncustom HTTP headers (except for the ones starting with Content- or If-),\nauthentication, and cookies\n(manually specified or sent by the server) persist between requests\nto the same host.\n# Create a new session:\n$ http --session=.\/session.json httpbin.org\/headers API-Token:123\n# Inspect \/ edit the generated session file:\n$ cat session.json\n# Re-use the existing session \u2014 the API-Token header will be set:\n$ http --session=.\/session.json httpbin.org\/headers\nAll session data, including credentials, cookie data,\nand custom headers are stored in plain text.\nThat means session files can also be created and edited manually in a text\neditor\u2014they are regular JSON. It also means that they can be read by anyone\nwho has access to the session file.\n\n24.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Named sessions\nYou can create one or more named session per host. For example, this is how\nyou can create a new session named user1 for httpbin.org:\n$ http --session=user1 -a user1:password httpbin.org\/get X-Foo:Bar\nFrom now on, you can refer to the session by its name (user1). When you choose\nto use the session again, any previously specified authentication or HTTP headers\nwill automatically be set:\n$ http --session=user1 httpbin.org\/get\nTo create or reuse a different session, simple specify a different name:\n$ http --session=user2 -a user2:password httpbin.org\/get X-Bar:Foo\nNamed sessions\u2019s data is stored in JSON files inside the sessions\nsubdirectory of the config directory, typically:\n~\/.config\/httpie\/sessions\/<host>\/<name>.json\n(%APPDATA%\\httpie\\sessions\\<host>\\<name>.json on Windows).\nIf you have executed the above commands on a unix machine,\nyou should be able list the generated sessions files using:\n$ ls -l ~\/.config\/httpie\/sessions\/httpbin.org\n\n24.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anonymous sessions\nInstead of a name, you can also directly specify a path to a session file. This\nallows for sessions to be re-used across multiple hosts:\n# Create a session:\n$ http --session=\/tmp\/session.json example.org\n# Use the session to make a request to another host:\n$ http --session=\/tmp\/session.json admin.example.org\n# You can also refer to a previously created named session:\n$ http --session=~\/.config\/httpie\/sessions\/another.example.org\/test.json example.org\nWhen creating anonymous sessions, please remember to always include at least\none \/, even if the session files is located in the current directory\n(i.e., --session=.\/session.json instead of just --session=session.json),\notherwise HTTPie assumes a named session instead.\n\n24.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Readonly session\nTo use an existing session file without updating it from the request\/response\nexchange after it has been created, specify the session name via\n--session-read-only=SESSION_NAME_OR_PATH instead.\n# If the session file doesn\u2019t exist, then it is created:\n$ http --session-read-only=.\/ro-session.json httpbin.org\/headers Custom-Header:orig-value\n# But it is not updated:\n$ http --session-read-only=.\/ro-session.json httpbin.org\/headers Custom-Header:new-value\n\n24.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cookie Storage Behaviour\nTL;DR: Cookie storage priority: Server response > Command line request > Session file\nTo set a cookie within a Session there are three options:\n\nGet a Set-Cookie header in a response from a server\n\n$ http --session=.\/session.json httpbin.org\/cookie\/set?foo=bar\n\nSet the cookie name and value through the command line as seen in cookies\n\n$ http --session=.\/session.json httpbin.org\/headers Cookie:foo=bar\n\nManually set cookie parameters in the json file of the session\n\n{\n    \"__meta__\": {\n    \"about\": \"HTTPie session file\",\n    \"help\": \"https:\/\/httpie.org\/doc#sessions\",\n    \"httpie\": \"2.2.0-dev\"\n    },\n    \"auth\": {\n        \"password\": null,\n        \"type\": null,\n        \"username\": null\n    },\n    \"cookies\": {\n        \"foo\": {\n            \"expires\": null,\n            \"path\": \"\/\",\n            \"secure\": false,\n            \"value\": \"bar\"\n            }\n    }\n}\nCookies will be set in the session file with the priority specified above. For example, a cookie\nset through the command line will overwrite a cookie of the same name stored\nin the session file. If the server returns a Set-Cookie header with a\ncookie of the same name, the returned cookie will overwrite the preexisting cookie.\nExpired cookies are never stored. If a cookie in a session file expires, it will be removed before\nsending a new request. If the server expires an existing cookie, it will also be removed from the\nsession file.\n\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Config\nHTTPie uses a simple config.json file. The file doesn\u2019t exist by default\nbut you can create it manually.\n\n25.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Config file directory\nTo see the exact location for your installation, run http --debug and\nlook for config_dir in the output.\nThe default location of the configuration file on most platforms is\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\/httpie\/config.json (defaulting to\n~\/.config\/httpie\/config.json).\nFor backwards compatibility, if the directory ~\/.httpie exists,\nthe configuration file there will be used instead.\nOn Windows, the config file is located at %APPDATA%\\httpie\\config.json.\nThe config directory can be changed by setting the $HTTPIE_CONFIG_DIR\nenvironment variable:\n$ export HTTPIE_CONFIG_DIR=\/tmp\/httpie\n$ http httpbin.org\/get\n\n25.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Configurable options\nCurrently HTTPie offers a single configurable option:\n\n25.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0default_options\nAn Array (by default empty) of default options that should be applied to\nevery invocation of HTTPie.\nFor instance, you can use this config option to change your default color theme:\n$ cat ~\/.config\/httpie\/config.json\n{\n    \"default_options\": [\n      \"--style=fruity\"\n    ]\n}\nEven though it is technically possible to include there any of HTTPie\u2019s\noptions, it is not recommended to modify the default behaviour in a way\nthat would break your compatibility with the wider world as that can\ngenerate a lot of confusion.\n\n25.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Un-setting previously specified options\nDefault options from the config file, or specified any other way,\ncan be unset for a particular invocation via --no-OPTION arguments passed\non the command line (e.g., --no-style or --no-session).\n\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scripting\nWhen using HTTPie from shell scripts, it can be handy to set the\n--check-status flag. It instructs HTTPie to exit with an error if the\nHTTP status is one of 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx. The exit status will\nbe 3 (unless --follow is set), 4, or 5,\nrespectively.\n#!\/bin\/bash\n\nif http --check-status --ignore-stdin --timeout=2.5 HEAD httpbin.org\/get &> \/dev\/null; then\n    echo 'OK!'\nelse\n    case $? in\n        2) echo 'Request timed out!' ;;\n        3) echo 'Unexpected HTTP 3xx Redirection!' ;;\n        4) echo 'HTTP 4xx Client Error!' ;;\n        5) echo 'HTTP 5xx Server Error!' ;;\n        6) echo 'Exceeded --max-redirects=<n> redirects!' ;;\n        *) echo 'Other Error!' ;;\n    esac\nfi\n\n26.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Best practices\nThe default behaviour of automatically reading stdin is typically not\ndesirable during non-interactive invocations. You most likely want to\nuse the --ignore-stdin option to disable it.\nIt is a common gotcha that without this option HTTPie seemingly hangs.\nWhat happens is that when HTTPie is invoked for example from a cron job,\nstdin is not connected to a terminal.\nTherefore, rules for redirected input apply, i.e., HTTPie starts to read it\nexpecting that the request body will be passed through.\nAnd since there\u2019s no data nor EOF, it will be stuck. So unless you\u2019re\npiping some data to HTTPie, this flag should be used in scripts.\nAlso, it might be good to set a connection --timeout limit to prevent\nyour program from hanging if the server never responds.\n\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meta\n\n27.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interface design\nThe syntax of the command arguments closely corresponds to the actual HTTP\nrequests sent over the wire. It has the advantage  that it\u2019s easy to remember\nand read. It is often possible to translate an HTTP request to an HTTPie\nargument list just by inlining the request elements. For example, compare this\nHTTP request:\nPOST \/post HTTP\/1.1\nHost: httpbin.org\nX-API-Key: 123\nUser-Agent: Bacon\/1.0\nContent-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nname=value&name2=value2\nwith the HTTPie command that sends it:\n$ http -f POST httpbin.org\/post \\\n  X-API-Key:123 \\\n  User-Agent:Bacon\/1.0 \\\n  name=value \\\n  name2=value2\nNotice that both the order of elements and the syntax is very similar,\nand that only a small portion of the command is used to control HTTPie and\ndoesn\u2019t directly correspond to any part of the request (here it\u2019s only -f\nasking HTTPie to send a form request).\nThe two modes, --pretty=all (default for terminal) and --pretty=none\n(default for redirected output), allow for both user-friendly interactive use\nand usage from scripts, where HTTPie serves as a generic HTTP client.\nAs HTTPie is still under heavy development, the existing command line\nsyntax and some of the --OPTIONS may change slightly before\nHTTPie reaches its final version 1.0. All changes are recorded in the\nchange log.\n\n27.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0User support\nPlease use the following support channels:\n\nGitHub issues\nfor bug reports and feature requests.\nOur Gitter chat room\nto ask questions, discuss features, and for general discussion.\nStackOverflow\nto ask questions (please make sure to use the\nhttpie tag).\nTweet directly to @httpie.\nYou can also tweet directly to @jakubroztocil.\n\n\n27.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Related projects\n\n27.3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dependencies\nUnder the hood, HTTPie uses these two amazing libraries:\n\nRequests\n\u2014 Python HTTP library for humans\nPygments\n\u2014 Python syntax highlighter\n\n\n27.3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HTTPie friends\nHTTPie plays exceptionally well with the following tools:\n\nhttp-prompt\n\u2014  interactive shell for HTTPie featuring autocomplete\nand command syntax highlighting\njq\n\u2014 CLI JSON processor that\nworks great in conjunction with HTTPie\n\nHelpers to convert from other client tools:\n\nCurliPie help convert cURL command line to HTTPie command line.\n\n\n27.3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternatives\n\nhttpcat \u2014 a lower-level sister utility\nof HTTPie for constructing raw HTTP requests on the command line.\ncurl \u2014 a \"Swiss knife\" command line tool and\nan exceptional library for transferring data with URLs.\n\n\n27.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contributing\nSee CONTRIBUTING.rst.\n\n27.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change log\nSee CHANGELOG.\n\n27.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Artwork\n\nLogo by Cl\u00e1udia Delgado.\nAnimation by Allen Smith of GitHub.\n\n\n27.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence\nBSD-3-Clause: LICENSE.\n\n27.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authors\nJakub Roztocil  (@jakubroztocil) created HTTPie and these fine people\nhave contributed.\n","131":"Awesome Machine Learning \nA curated list of awesome machine learning frameworks, libraries and software (by language).

This is intended for use in helping both automated and manual QA testing; useful for whenever your QA engineer walks into a bar.\nWhy Test Naughty Strings?\nEven multi-billion dollar companies with huge amounts of automated testing can't find every bad input. For example, look at what happens when you try to Tweet a zero-width space (U+200B) on Twitter:\n\nAlthough this is not a malicious error, and typical users aren't Tweeting weird unicode, an \"internal server error\" for unexpected input is never a positive experience for the user, and may in fact be a symptom of deeper string-validation issues. The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to help reveal such issues.\nUsage\nblns.txt consists of newline-delimited strings and comments which are preceded with #. The comments divide the strings into sections for easy manual reading and copy\/pasting into input forms. For those who want to access the strings programmatically, a blns.json file is provided containing an array with all the comments stripped out (the scripts folder contains a Python script used to generate the blns.json).\nContributions\nFeel free to send a pull request to add more strings, or additional sections. However, please do not send pull requests with very-long strings (255+ characters), as that makes the list much more difficult to view.\nLikewise, please do not send pull requests which compromise manual usability of the file. This includes the EICAR test string, which can cause the file to be flagged by antivirus scanners, and files which alter the encoding of blns.txt. Also, do not send a null character (U+0000) string, as it changes the file format on GitHub to binary and renders it unreadable in pull requests. Finally, when adding or removing a string please update all files when you perform a pull request.\nDisclaimer\nThe Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to be used for software you own and manage. Some of the Naughty Strings can indicate security vulnerabilities, and as a result using such strings with third-party software may be a crime. The maintainer is not responsible for any negative actions that result from the use of the list.\nAdditionally, the Big List of Naughty Strings is not a fully-comprehensive substitute for formal security\/penetration testing for your service.\nLibrary \/ Packages\nVarious implementations of the Big List of Naughty Strings have made it to various package managers.

It works best on scraping large-sized images from popular websites like Tumblr and Blogger, but there is really no universal pattern that can apply to any site on the Internet.\n\nSearch on Google Videos and download\nYou can pass literally anything to you-get. If it isn't a valid URL, you-get will do a Google search and download the most relevant video for you. (It might not be exactly the thing you wish to see, but still very likely.)\n$ you-get \"Richard Stallman eats\"\n\nPause and resume a download\nYou may use Ctrl+C to interrupt a download.\nA temporary .download file is kept in the output directory. Next time you run you-get with the same arguments, the download progress will resume from the last session. In case the file is completely downloaded (the temporary .download extension is gone), you-get will just skip the download.\nTo enforce re-downloading, use the --force\/-f option. (Warning: doing so will overwrite any existing file or temporary file with the same name!)\nSet the path and name of downloaded file\nUse the --output-dir\/-o option to set the path, and --output-filename\/-O to set the name of the downloaded file:\n$ you-get -o ~\/Videos -O zoo.webm 'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'\n\nTips:\n\nThese options are helpful if you encounter problems with the default video titles, which may contain special characters that do not play well with your current shell \/ operating system \/ filesystem.\nThese options are also helpful if you write a script to batch download files and put them into designated folders with designated names.\n\nProxy settings\nYou may specify an HTTP proxy for you-get to use, via the --http-proxy\/-x option:\n$ you-get -x 127.0.0.1:8087 'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'\n\nHowever, the system proxy setting (i.e. the environment variable http_proxy) is applied by default. To disable any proxy, use the --no-proxy option.\nTips:\n\nIf you need to use proxies a lot (in case your network is blocking certain sites), you might want to use you-get with proxychains and set alias you-get=\"proxychains -q you-get\" (in Bash).\nFor some websites (e.g. Youku), if you need access to some videos that are only available in mainland China, there is an option of using a specific proxy to extract video information from the site: --extractor-proxy\/-y.\n\nWatch a video\nUse the --player\/-p option to feed the video into your media player of choice, e.g. mpv or vlc, instead of downloading it:\n$ you-get -p vlc 'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'\n\nOr, if you prefer to watch the video in a browser, just without ads or comment section:\n$ you-get -p chromium 'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'\n\nTips:\n\nIt is possible to use the -p option to start another download manager, e.g., you-get -p uget-gtk 'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw', though they may not play together very well.\n\nLoad cookies\nNot all videos are publicly available to anyone. If you need to log in your account to access something (e.g., a private video), it would be unavoidable to feed the browser cookies to you-get via the --cookies\/-c option.\nNote:\n\nAs of now, we are supporting two formats of browser cookies: Mozilla cookies.sqlite and Netscape cookies.txt.\n\nReuse extracted data\nUse --url\/-u to get a list of downloadable resource URLs extracted from the page. Use --json to get an abstract of extracted data in the JSON format.\nWarning:\n\nFor the time being, this feature has NOT been stabilized and the JSON schema may have breaking changes in the future.\n\nSupported

There is current a bug in the CUDA libraries on the Jetson Nano that will cause this library to fail silently if you don't follow the instructions in the article to comment out a line in dlib and recompile it.\n\n\n\nInstalling on Raspberry Pi 2+\n\nRaspberry Pi 2+ installation instructions\n\nInstalling on FreeBSD\npkg install graphics\/py-face_recognition\nInstalling on Windows\nWhile Windows isn't officially supported, helpful users have posted instructions on how to install this library:\n\n@masoudr's Windows 10 installation guide (dlib + face_recognition)\n\nInstalling a pre-configured Virtual Machine image\n\nDownload the pre-configured VM image (for VMware Player or VirtualBox).\n\nUsage\nCommand-Line Interface\nWhen you install face_recognition, you get two simple command-line\nprograms:\n\nface_recognition - Recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for\nphotographs.\nface_detection - Find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.\n\nface_recognition command line tool\nThe face_recognition command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or\nfolder full  for photographs.\nFirst, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you\nalready know. There should be one image file for each person with the\nfiles named according to who is in the picture:\n\nNext, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:\n\nThen in you simply run the command face_recognition, passing in\nthe folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with unknown\npeople and it tells you who is in each image:\n$ face_recognition .\/pictures_of_people_i_know\/ .\/unknown_pictures\/\n\n\/unknown_pictures\/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama\n\/face_recognition_test\/unknown_pictures\/unknown.jpg,unknown_person\nThere's one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated\nwith the filename and the name of the person found.\nAn unknown_person is a face in the image that didn't match anyone in\nyour folder of known people.\nface_detection command line tool\nThe face_detection command lets you find the location (pixel coordinatates)\nof any faces in an image.\nJust run the command face_detection, passing in a folder of images\nto check (or a single image):\n$ face_detection  .\/folder_with_pictures\/\n\nexamples\/image1.jpg,65,215,169,112\nexamples\/image2.jpg,62,394,211,244\nexamples\/image2.jpg,95,941,244,792\nIt prints one line for each face that was detected. The coordinates\nreported are the top, right, bottom and left coordinates of the face (in pixels).\nAdjusting Tolerance \/ Sensitivity\nIf you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that\nthe people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value\nis needed to make face comparisons more strict.\nYou can do that with the --tolerance parameter. The default tolerance\nvalue is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:\n$ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 .\/pictures_of_people_i_know\/ .\/unknown_pictures\/\n\n\/unknown_pictures\/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama\n\/face_recognition_test\/unknown_pictures\/unknown.jpg,unknown_person\nIf you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order\nto adjust the tolerance setting, you can use --show-distance true:\n$ face_recognition --show-distance true .\/pictures_of_people_i_know\/ .\/unknown_pictures\/\n\n\/unknown_pictures\/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785\n\/face_recognition_test\/unknown_pictures\/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None\nMore Examples\nIf you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't\ncare about file names, you could do this:\n$ face_recognition .\/pictures_of_people_i_know\/ .\/unknown_pictures\/ | cut -d ',' -f2\n\nBarack Obama\nunknown_person\nSpeeding up Face Recognition\nFace recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with\nmultiple CPU cores. For example, if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can\nprocess about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using\nall your CPU cores in parallel.\nIf you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a --cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use> parameter:\n$ face_recognition --cpus 4 .\/pictures_of_people_i_know\/ .\/unknown_pictures\/\nYou can also pass in --cpus -1 to use all CPU cores in your system.\nPython Module\nYou can import the face_recognition module and then easily manipulate\nfaces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!\nAPI Docs: https:\/\/face-recognition.readthedocs.io.\nAutomatically find all the faces in an image\nimport face_recognition\n\nimage = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"my_picture.jpg\")\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\n\n# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!\nSee this example\nto try it out.\nYou can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.\nNote: GPU acceleration (via NVidia's CUDA library) is required for good\nperformance with this model.

However, it requires some custom configuration to work with this library. See this issue for how to do it.\nArticles and Guides that cover face_recognition\n\nMy article on how Face Recognition works: Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning\n\nCovers the algorithms and how they generally work\n\n\nFace recognition with OpenCV, Python, and deep learning by Adrian Rosebrock\n\nCovers how to use face recognition in practice\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Face Recognition by Adrian Rosebrock\n\nCovers how to use this on a Raspberry Pi\n\n\nFace clustering with Python by Adrian Rosebrock\n\nCovers how to automatically cluster photos based on who appears in each photo using unsupervised learning\n\n\n\nHow Face Recognition Works\nIf you want to learn how face location and recognition work instead of\ndepending on a black box library, read my article.\nCaveats\n\nThe face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work very well on children. It tends to mix\nup children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.\nAccuracy may vary between ethnic groups. Please see this wiki page for more details.\n\nDeployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)\nSince face_recognition depends on dlib which is written in C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app\nusing it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.\nTo make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that shows how to run an app built with\nface_recognition in a Docker container. With that, you should be able to deploy\nto any service that supports Docker images.\nYou can try the Docker image locally by running: docker-compose up --build\nLinux users with a GPU (drivers >= 384.81) and Nvidia-Docker installed can run the example on the GPU: Open the docker-compose.yml file and uncomment the dockerfile: Dockerfile.gpu and runtime: nvidia lines.\nHaving problems?\nIf you run into problems, please read the Common Errors section of the wiki before filing a github issue.\nThanks\n\nMany, many thanks to Davis King (@nulhom)\nfor creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature detection and face encoding models\nused in this library. For more information on the ResNet that powers the face encodings, check out\nhis blog post.\nThanks to everyone who works on all the awesome Python data science libraries like numpy, scipy, scikit-image,\npillow, etc, etc that makes this kind of stuff so easy and fun in Python.\nThanks to Cookiecutter and the\naudreyr\/cookiecutter-pypackage project template\nfor making Python project packaging way more tolerable.\n\n","140":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState-of-the-art Natural Language Processing for PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0\n\n\ud83e\udd17 Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, etc in 100+ languages. Its aim is to make cutting-edge NLP easier to use for everyone.\n\ud83e\udd17 Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets then share them with the community on our model hub. At the same time, each python module defining an architecture can be used as a standalone and modified to enable quick research experiments.\n\ud83e\udd17 Transformers is backed by the two most popular deep learning libraries, PyTorch and TensorFlow, with a seamless integration between them, allowing you to train your models with one then load it for inference with the other.\nRecent contributors\n\nOnline demos\nYou can test most of our models directly on their pages from the model hub. We also offer an inference API to use those models.\nHere are a few examples:\n\nMasked word completion with BERT\nName Entity Recognition with Electra\nText generation with GPT-2\nNatural Langugage Inference with RoBERTa\nSummarization with BART\nQuestion answering with DistilBERT\nTranslation with T5\n\nWrite With Transformer, built by the Hugging Face team, is the official demo of this repo\u2019s text generation capabilities.\nQuick tour\nTo immediately use a model on a given text, we provide the pipeline API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\n>>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n>>> classifier('We are very happy to include pipeline into the transformers repository.')\n[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9978193640708923}]\nThe second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, the third line evaluates it on the given text. Here the answer is \"positive\" with a confidence of 99.8%.\nThis is another example of pipeline used for that can extract question answers from some context:\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for question-answering\n>>> question_answerer = pipeline('question-answering')\n>>> question_answerer({\n...     'question': 'What is the name of the repository ?',\n...     'context': 'Pipeline have been included in the huggingface\/transformers repository'\n... })\n{'score': 0.5135612454720828, 'start': 35, 'end': 59, 'answer': 'huggingface\/transformers'}\nOn top of the answer, the pretrained model used here returned its confidence score, along with the start position and its end position in the tokenized sentence. You can learn more about the tasks supported by the pipeline API in this tutorial.\nTo download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, you just need to use those three lines of codes (PyTorch version):\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\nor for TensorFlow:\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"tf\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\nThe tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects, and can be called directly on one (or list) of texts (as we can see on the fourth line of both code examples). It will output a dictionary you can directly pass to your model (which is done on the fifth line).\nThe model itself is a regular Pytorch nn.Module or a TensorFlow tf.keras.Model (depending on your backend) which you can use normally. For instance, this tutorial explains how to integrate such a model in classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our Trainer API to quickly fine-tune the on a new dataset.\nWhy should I use transformers?\n\n\nEasy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\n\nHigh performance on NLU and NLG tasks.\nLow barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.\nFew user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.\nA unified API for using all our pretrained models.\n\n\n\nLower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\n\nResearchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.\nPractitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.\nDozens of architectures with over 2,000 pretrained models, some in more than 100 languages.\n\n\n\nChoose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:\n\nTrain state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.\nMove a single model between TF2.0\/PyTorch frameworks at will.\nSeamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, production.\n\n\n\nEasily customize a model or an example to your needs:\n\nExamples for each architecture to reproduce the results by the official authors of said architecture.\nExpose the models internal as consistently as possible.\nModel files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.\n\n\n\nWhy shouldn't I use transformers?\n\nThis library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving in additional abstractions\/files.\nThe training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library.\nWhile we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our examples folder are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.\n\nInstallation\nThis repository is tested on Python 3.6+, PyTorch 1.0.0+ (PyTorch 1.3.1+ for examples) and TensorFlow 2.0.\nYou should install \ud83e\udd17 Transformers in a virtual environment. If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the user guide.\nFirst, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.\nThen, you will need to install one of, or both, TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.\nPlease refer to TensorFlow installation page and\/or PyTorch installation page regarding the specific install command for your platform.\nWhen TensorFlow 2.0 and\/or PyTorch has been installed, \ud83e\udd17 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:\npip install transformers\nIf you'd like to play with the examples, you must install the library from source.\nModels architectures\n\ud83e\udd17 Transformers currently provides the following architectures (see here for a high-level summary of each them):\n\nALBERT (from Google Research and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) released with the paper ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations, by Zhenzhong Lan, Mingda Chen, Sebastian Goodman, Kevin Gimpel, Piyush Sharma, Radu Soricut.\nBART (from Facebook) released with the paper BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension by Mike Lewis, Yinhan Liu, Naman Goyal, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Omer Levy, Ves Stoyanov and Luke Zettlemoyer.\nBERT (from Google) released with the paper BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding by Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee and Kristina Toutanova.\nBERT For Sequence Generation (from Google) released with the paper Leveraging Pre-trained Checkpoints for Sequence Generation Tasks by Sascha Rothe, Shashi Narayan, Aliaksei Severyn.\nBlenderbot (from Facebook) released with the paper Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot by Stephen Roller, Emily Dinan, Naman Goyal, Da Ju, Mary Williamson, Yinhan Liu, Jing Xu, Myle Ott, Kurt Shuster, Eric M.

On macOS case-insensitive file systems and on Cygwin,\nthe executable is called python.exe; elsewhere it's just python.\nBuilding a complete Python installation requires the use of various\nadditional third-party libraries, depending on your build platform and\nconfigure options.  Not all standard library modules are buildable or\nuseable on all platforms.  Refer to the\nInstall dependencies\nsection of the Developer Guide for current detailed information on\ndependencies for various Linux distributions and macOS.\nOn macOS, there are additional configure and build options related\nto macOS framework and universal builds.  Refer to Mac\/README.rst.\nOn Windows, see PCbuild\/readme.txt.\nIf you wish, you can create a subdirectory and invoke configure from there.\nFor example:\nmkdir debug\ncd debug\n..\/configure --with-pydebug\nmake\nmake test\n\n(This will fail if you also built at the top-level directory.  You should do\na make clean at the top-level first.)\nTo get an optimized build of Python, configure --enable-optimizations\nbefore you run make.  This sets the default make targets up to enable\nProfile Guided Optimization (PGO) and may be used to auto-enable Link Time\nOptimization (LTO) on some platforms.  For more details, see the sections\nbelow.\n\nProfile Guided Optimization\nPGO takes advantage of recent versions of the GCC or Clang compilers.  If used,\neither via configure --enable-optimizations or by manually running\nmake profile-opt regardless of configure flags, the optimized build\nprocess will perform the following steps:\nThe entire Python directory is cleaned of temporary files that may have\nresulted from a previous compilation.\nAn instrumented version of the interpreter is built, using suitable compiler\nflags for each flavour. Note that this is just an intermediary step.  The\nbinary resulting from this step is not good for real life workloads as it has\nprofiling instructions embedded inside.\nAfter the instrumented interpreter is built, the Makefile will run a training\nworkload.  This is necessary in order to profile the interpreter execution.\nNote also that any output, both stdout and stderr, that may appear at this step\nis suppressed.\nThe final step is to build the actual interpreter, using the information\ncollected from the instrumented one.  The end result will be a Python binary\nthat is optimized; suitable for distribution or production installation.\n\nLink Time Optimization\nEnabled via configure's --with-lto flag.  LTO takes advantage of the\nability of recent compiler toolchains to optimize across the otherwise\narbitrary .o file boundary when building final executables or shared\nlibraries for additional performance gains.\n\nWhat's New\nWe have a comprehensive overview of the changes in the What's New in Python\n3.10 document.  For a more\ndetailed change log, read Misc\/NEWS, but a full\naccounting of changes can only be gleaned from the commit history.\nIf you want to install multiple versions of Python, see the section below\nentitled \"Installing multiple versions\".\n\nDocumentation\nDocumentation for Python 3.10 is online,\nupdated daily.\nIt can also be downloaded in many formats for faster access.  The documentation\nis downloadable in HTML, PDF, and reStructuredText formats; the latter version\nis primarily for documentation authors, translators, and people with special\nformatting requirements.\nFor information about building Python's documentation, refer to Doc\/README.rst.\n\nConverting From Python 2.x to 3.x\nSignificant backward incompatible changes were made for the release of Python\n3.0, which may cause programs written for Python 2 to fail when run with Python\n3.  For more information about porting your code from Python 2 to Python 3, see\nthe Porting HOWTO.\n\nTesting\nTo test the interpreter, type make test in the top-level directory.  The\ntest set produces some output.  You can generally ignore the messages about\nskipped tests due to optional features which can't be imported.  If a message\nis printed about a failed test or a traceback or core dump is produced,\nsomething is wrong.\nBy default, tests are prevented from overusing resources like disk space and\nmemory.  To enable these tests, run make testall.\nIf any tests fail, you can re-run the failing test(s) in verbose mode.  For\nexample, if test_os and test_gdb failed, you can run:\nmake test TESTOPTS=\"-v test_os test_gdb\"\n\nIf the failure persists and appears to be a problem with Python rather than\nyour environment, you can file a bug report and\ninclude relevant output from that command to show the issue.\nSee Running & Writing Tests\nfor more on running tests.\n\nInstalling multiple versions\nOn Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of Python\nusing the same installation prefix (--prefix argument to the configure\nscript) you must take care that your primary python executable is not\noverwritten by the installation of a different version.  All files and\ndirectories installed using make altinstall contain the major and minor\nversion and can thus live side-by-side.  make install also creates\n${prefix}\/bin\/python3 which refers to ${prefix}\/bin\/pythonX.Y.  If you\nintend to install multiple versions using the same prefix you must decide which\nversion (if any) is your \"primary\" version.  Install that version using make\ninstall.  Install all other versions using make altinstall.\nFor example, if you want to install Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.10 with 3.10 being the\nprimary version, you would execute make install in your 3.10 build directory\nand make altinstall in the others.\n\nIssue Tracker and Mailing List\nBug reports are welcome!  You can use the issue tracker to report bugs, and\/or submit pull requests on\nGitHub.\nYou can also follow development discussion on the python-dev mailing list.\n\nProposals for enhancement\nIf you have a proposal to change Python, you may want to send an email to the\ncomp.lang.python or python-ideas mailing lists for initial feedback.  A\nPython Enhancement Proposal (PEP) may be submitted if your idea gains ground.\nAll current PEPs, as well as guidelines for submitting a new PEP, are listed at\npython.org\/dev\/peps\/.\n\nRelease Schedule\nSee PEP 619 for Python 3.10 release details.\n\nCopyright and License Information\nCopyright (c) 2001-2020 Python Software Foundation.

What is a neural network?\n\n\n\nManifesto\nFaceSwap has ethical uses.\nWhen faceswapping was first developed and published, the technology was groundbreaking, it was a huge step in AI development. It was also completely ignored outside of academia because the code was confusing and fragmentary. It required a thorough understanding of complicated AI techniques and took a lot of effort to figure it out. Until one individual brought it together into a single, cohesive collection. It ran, it worked, and as is so often the way with new technology emerging on the internet, it was immediately used to create inappropriate content. Despite the inappropriate uses the software was given originally, it was the first AI code that anyone could download, run and learn by experimentation without having a Ph.D. in math, computer theory, psychology, and more. Before \"deepfakes\" these techniques were like black magic, only practiced by those who could understand all of the inner workings as described in esoteric and endlessly complicated books and papers.\n\"Deepfakes\" changed all that and anyone could participate in AI development. To us, developers, the release of this code opened up a fantastic learning opportunity. It allowed us to build on ideas developed by others, collaborate with a variety of skilled coders, experiment with AI whilst learning new skills and ultimately contribute towards an emerging technology which will only see more mainstream use as it progresses.\nAre there some out there doing horrible things with similar software? Yes. And because of this, the developers have been following strict ethical standards. Many of us don't even use it to create videos, we just tinker with the code to see what it does. Sadly, the media concentrates only on the unethical uses of this software. That is, unfortunately, the nature of how it was first exposed to the public, but it is not representative of why it was created, how we use it now, or what we see in its future. Like any technology, it can be used for good or it can be abused. It is our intention to develop FaceSwap in a way that its potential for abuse is minimized whilst maximizing its potential as a tool for learning, experimenting and, yes, for legitimate faceswapping.\nWe are not trying to denigrate celebrities or to demean anyone. We are programmers, we are engineers, we are Hollywood VFX artists, we are activists, we are hobbyists, we are human beings. To this end, we feel that it's time to come out with a standard statement of what this software is and isn't as far as us developers are concerned.\n\nFaceSwap is not for creating inappropriate content.\nFaceSwap is not for changing faces without consent or with the intent of hiding its use.\nFaceSwap is not for any illicit, unethical, or questionable purposes.\nFaceSwap exists to experiment and discover AI techniques, for social or political commentary, for movies, and for any number of ethical and reasonable uses.\n\nWe are very troubled by the fact that FaceSwap can be used for unethical and disreputable things. However, we support the development of tools and techniques that can be used ethically as well as provide education and experience in AI for anyone who wants to learn it hands-on. We will take a zero tolerance approach to anyone using this software for any unethical purposes and will actively discourage any such uses.\nHow To setup and run the project\nFaceSwap is a Python program that will run on multiple Operating Systems including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.\nSee INSTALL.md for full installation instructions. You will need a modern GPU with CUDA support for best performance. AMD GPUs are partially supported.\nOverview\nThe project has multiple entry points. You will have to:\n\nGather photos and\/or videos\nExtract faces from your raw photos\nTrain a model on the faces extracted from the photos\/videos\nConvert your sources with the model\n\nCheck out USAGE.md for more detailed instructions.\nExtract\nFrom your setup folder, run python faceswap.py extract. This will take photos from src folder and extract faces into extract folder.\nTrain\nFrom your setup folder, run python faceswap.py train. This will take photos from two folders containing pictures of both faces and train a model that will be saved inside the models folder.\nConvert\nFrom your setup folder, run python faceswap.py convert. This will take photos from original folder and apply new faces into modified folder.\nGUI\nAlternatively, you can run the GUI by running python faceswap.py gui\nGeneral notes:\n\nAll of the scripts mentioned have -h\/--help options with arguments that they will accept. You're smart, you can figure out how this works, right?!\n\nNB: there is a conversion tool for video. This can be accessed by running python tools.py effmpeg -h. Alternatively, you can use ffmpeg to convert video into photos, process images, and convert images back to the video.\nSome tips:\nReusing existing models will train much faster than starting from nothing.\nIf there is not enough training data, start with someone who looks similar, then switch the data.\nHelp I need support!\nDiscord Server\nYour best bet is to join the FaceSwap Discord server where there are plenty of users willing to help. Please note that, like this repo, this is a SFW Server!\nFaceSwap Forum\nAlternatively, you can post questions in the FaceSwap Forum. Please do not post general support questions in this repo as they are liable to be deleted without response.\nDonate\nThe developers work tirelessly to improve and develop FaceSwap. Many hours have been put in to provide the software as it is today, but this is an extremely time-consuming process with no financial reward. If you enjoy using the software, please consider donating to the devs, so they can spend more time implementing improvements.\nPatreon\nThe best way to support us is through our Patreon page:\n\nOne time Donations\nAlternatively you can give a one off donation to any of our Devs:\n@torzdf\nThere is very little FaceSwap code that hasn't been touched by torzdf. He is responsible for implementing the GUI, FAN aligner, MTCNN detector and porting the Villain, DFL-H128 and DFaker models to FaceSwap, as well as significantly improving many areas of the code.\nBitcoin: 385a1r9tyZpt5LyZcNk1FALTxC8ZHta7yq\nEthereum: 0x18CBbff5fA7C78de7B949A2b0160A0d1bd649f80\nPaypal: \n@andenixa\nCreator of the Unbalanced and OHR models, as well as expanding various capabilities within the training process. Andenixa is currently working on new models and will take requests for donations.\nPaypal: \n@kvrooman\nResponsible for consolidating the converters, adding a lot of code to fix model stability issues, and helping significantly towards making the training process more modular, kvrooman continues to be a very active contributor.\nEthereum: 0x18CBbff5fA7C78de7B949A2b0160A0d1bd649f80\nHow to contribute\nFor people interested in the generative models\n\nGo to the 'faceswap-model' to discuss\/suggest\/commit alternatives to the current algorithm.\n\nFor devs\n\nRead this README entirely\nFork the repo\nPlay with it\nCheck issues with the 'dev' tag\nFor devs more interested in computer vision and openCV, look at issues with the 'opencv' tag. Also feel free to add your own alternatives\/improvements\n\nFor non-dev advanced users\n\nRead this README entirely\nClone the repo\nPlay with it\nCheck issues with the 'advuser' tag\nAlso go to the 'faceswap Forum' and help others.\n\nFor end-users\n\nGet the code here and play with it if you can\nYou can also go to the faceswap Forum and help or get help from others.\nBe patient. This is a relatively new technology for developers as well. Much effort is already being put into making this program easy to use for the average user. It just takes time!\nNotice Any issue related to running the code has to be opened in the faceswap Forum!\n\nFor haters\nSorry, no time for that.\nAbout github.com\/deepfakes\nWhat is this repo?\nIt is a community repository for active users.\nWhy this repo?\nThe joshua-wu repo seems not active. Simple bugs like missing http:\/\/ in front of urls have not been solved since days.\nWhy is it named 'deepfakes' if it is not \/u\/deepfakes?\n\nBecause a typosquat would have happened sooner or later as project grows\nBecause we wanted to recognize the original author\nBecause it will better federate contributors and users\n\nWhat if \/u\/deepfakes feels bad about that?\nThis is a friendly typosquat, and it is fully dedicated to the project. If \/u\/deepfakes wants to take over this repo\/user and drive the project, he is welcomed to do so (Raise an issue, and he will be contacted on Reddit). Please do not send \/u\/deepfakes messages for help with the code you find here.\nAbout machine learning\nHow does a computer know how to recognize\/shape faces? How does machine learning work? What is a neural network?\nIt's complicated. Here's a good video that makes the process understandable:\n\nHere's a slightly more in depth video that tries to explain the basic functioning of a neural network:\n\ntl;dr: training data + trial and error\n","144":"Removed according to regulations.\n","145":"\nSuperset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application.\nWhy Superset |\nSupported Databases |\nInstallation and Configuration |\nGet Help |\nContributor Guide |\nResources |\nSuperset Users\nScreenshots & Gifs\nGallery\n\nView Dashboards\n\nSlice & dice your data\n\nQuery and visualize your data with SQL Lab\n\nVisualize geospatial data with deck.gl\n\nChoose from a wide array of visualizations\n\nWhy Superset\nSuperset provides:\n\nAn intuitive interface to explore and visualize datasets, and\ncreate interactive dashboards.\nA wide array of beautiful visualizations to showcase your data.\nEasy, code-free, user flows to drill down and slice and dice the data\nunderlying exposed dashboards.

Stroustrup\n\nThe C++ Core Guidelines are a collaborative effort led by Bjarne Stroustrup, much like the C++ language itself. They are the result of many\nperson-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations. Their design encourages general applicability and broad adoption but\nthey can be freely copied and modified to meet your organization's needs.\nGetting started\nThe guidelines themselves are found at CppCoreGuidelines. The document is in GH-flavored MarkDown. It is intentionally kept simple, mostly in ASCII, to allow automatic post-processing such as language translation and reformatting. The editors maintain one\nversion formatted for browsing. Note that it is manually integrated and can be slightly older than the version in the master branch.\nThe Guidelines are a constantly evolving document without a strict \"release\" cadence. Bjarne Stroustrup periodically reviews the document and increments the version number in the introduction. Checkins that increment the version number are tagged in git.\nMany of the guidelines make use of the header-only Guidelines Support Library. One implementation is available at GSL: Guidelines Support Library.\nBackground and scope\nThe aim of the guidelines is to help people to use modern C++ effectively. By \"modern C++\" we mean C++11, C++14, and C++17. In other\nwords, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years' time, given that you can start now? In 10 years' time?\nThe guidelines are focused on relatively higher-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency. Such\nrules affect application architecture and library design. Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type-safe, has no resource\nleaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today. And it will run fast -- you can afford to do things right.\nWe are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style. However, no topic that can help a programmer is\nout of bounds.\nOur initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity. They may very well be too strict. We expect to have to introduce\nmore exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs. We also need more rules.\nYou will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience. If we haven't suggested that you change your\ncoding style in any way, we have failed! Please try to verify or disprove rules! In particular, we'd really like to have some of our rules\nbacked up with measurements or better examples.\nYou will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial. Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less\nexperienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.\nThe rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool. Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.\nWe do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.\nThe rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base. We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.\nContributions and LICENSE\nComments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome. We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the\nlanguage and the set of available libraries improve. More details are found at CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE.\nThanks to DigitalOcean for hosting the Standard C++ Foundation website.\n","149":"12306 \u8d2d\u7968\u5c0f\u52a9\u624b\npython\u7248\u672c\n\n

It's used to create precise animations programmatically, as seen in the videos at 3Blue1Brown.\nThis repository contains the version of manim used by 3Blue1Brown. There is also a community maintained version at https:\/\/github.com\/ManimCommunity\/manim\/.\nTo get help or to join the development effort, please join the discord.\nInstallation\nManim runs on Python 3.6 or higher version. You can install it from PyPI via pip:\npip3 install manimlib\nSystem requirements are cairo, ffmpeg, sox (optional, if you want to play the prompt tone after running), latex (optional, if you want to use LaTeX).\nYou can now use it via the manim command. For example:\nmanim my_project.py MyScene\nFor more options, take a look at the Using manim sections further below.\nDirectly\nIf you want to hack on manimlib itself, clone this repository and in that directory execute:\n# Install python requirements\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Try it out\npython3 .\/manim.py example_scenes.py SquareToCircle -pl\nDirectly (Windows)\n\n\nInstall FFmpeg.\n\n\nInstall Cairo. For most users, pycairo\u20111.18.0\u2011cp37\u2011cp37m\u2011win32.whl will do fine (you can download it or other versions from here).\npip3 install C:\\path\\to\\wheel\\pycairo\u20111.18.0\u2011cp37\u2011cp37m\u2011win32.whl\n\n\nInstall a LaTeX distribution. MiKTeX is recommended.\n\n\nInstall SoX.\n\n\nInstall the remaining Python packages.\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/3b1b\/manim.git\ncd manim\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\npython3 manim.py example_scenes.py SquareToCircle -pl\n\n\nAnaconda Install\n\nInstall sox and latex as above.\nCreate a conda environment using conda env create -f environment.yml\nWINDOWS ONLY Install pyreadline via pip install pyreadline.\n\nUsing virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper\nAfter installing virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/3b1b\/manim.git\nmkvirtualenv -a manim -r requirements.txt manim\npython3 -m manim example_scenes.py SquareToCircle -pl\nUsing Docker\nSince it's a bit tricky to get all the dependencies set up just right, there is a Dockerfile and Compose file provided in this repo as well as a premade image on Docker Hub. The Dockerfile contains instructions on how to build a manim image, while the Compose file contains instructions on how to run the image.\nThe prebuilt container image has manim repository included.\nINPUT_PATH is where the container looks for scene files. You must set the INPUT_PATH\nenvironment variable to the absolute path containing your scene file and the\nOUTPUT_PATH environment variable to the directory where you want media to be written.\n\nInstall Docker\nInstall Docker Compose\nRender an animation:\n\nINPUT_PATH=\/path\/to\/dir\/containing\/source\/code \\\nOUTPUT_PATH=\/path\/to\/output\/ \\\ndocker-compose run manim example_scenes.py SquareToCircle -l\nThe command needs to be run as root if your username is not in the docker group.\nYou can replace example.scenes.py with any relative path from your INPUT_PATH.\n\nAfter running the output will say files ready at \/tmp\/output\/, which refers to path inside the container. Your OUTPUT_PATH is bind mounted to this \/tmp\/output so any changes made by the container to \/tmp\/output will be mirrored on your OUTPUT_PATH. \/media\/ will be created in OUTPUT_PATH.\n-p won't work as manim would look for video player in the container system, which it does not have.\nThe first time you execute the above command, Docker will pull the image from Docker Hub and cache it. Any subsequent runs until the image is evicted will use the cached image.\nNote that the image doesn't have any development tools installed and can't preview animations. Its purpose is building and testing only.\nUsing manim\nTry running the following:\npython3 -m manim example_scenes.py SquareToCircle -pl\nThe -p flag in the command above is for previewing, meaning the video file will automatically open when it is done rendering. The -l flag is for a faster rendering at a lower quality.\nSome other useful flags include:\n\n-s to skip to the end and just show the final frame.\n-n <number> to skip ahead to the n'th animation of a scene.\n-f to show the file in finder (for OSX).\n\nSet MEDIA_DIR environment variable to specify where the image and animation files will be written.\nLook through the old_projects folder to see the code for previous 3b1b videos. Note, however, that developments are often made to the library without considering backwards compatibility with those old projects. To run an old project with a guarantee that it will work, you will have to go back to the commit which completed that project.\nWhile developing a scene, the -sp flags are helpful to just see what things look like at the end without having to generate the full animation. It can also be helpful to use the -n flag to skip over some number of animations.\nDocumentation\nDocumentation is in progress at eulertour.com\/docs. And there is also an all-in-one documentation and tutorials maintained by @manim-kindergarten: manim.ml (in Chinese).\nWalkthrough\nTodd Zimmerman put together a tutorial on getting started with manim, which has been updated to run on Python 3.7.\nmanim-kindergarten wrote and collected some useful extra classes and some codes of videos in manim_sandbox repo.\nContributing\nOnly accepts pull requests that fixes bugs \/ fixes typos \/ improves existing content (for more information, see #1243).

Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let\u2019s Encrypt\u2014an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others\u2014and deploys it to a web server.\nAnyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let\u2019s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let's Encrypt is free, so there\u2019s no need to arrange payment.\nHow you use Certbot depends on the configuration of your web server. The best way to get started is to use our interactive guide. It generates instructions based on your configuration settings. In most cases, you\u2019ll need root or administrator access to your web server to run Certbot.\nCertbot is meant to be run directly on your web server, not on your personal computer. If you\u2019re using a hosted service and don\u2019t have direct access to your web server, you might not be able to use Certbot. Check with your hosting provider for documentation about uploading certificates or using certificates issued by Let\u2019s Encrypt.\nCertbot is a fully-featured, extensible client for the Let's\nEncrypt CA (or any other CA that speaks the ACME\nprotocol) that can automate the tasks of obtaining certificates and\nconfiguring webservers to use them. This client runs on Unix-based operating\nsystems.\nTo see the changes made to Certbot between versions please refer to our\nchangelog.\nUntil May 2016, Certbot was named simply letsencrypt or letsencrypt-auto,\ndepending on install method. Instructions on the Internet, and some pieces of the\nsoftware, may still refer to this older name.\n\nContributing\nIf you'd like to contribute to this project please read Developer Guide.\nThis project is governed by EFF's Public Projects Code of Conduct.\n\nHow to run the client\nThe easiest way to install and run Certbot is by visiting certbot.eff.org,\nwhere you can find the correct instructions for many web server and OS\ncombinations.  For more information, see Get Certbot.\n\nUnderstanding the client in more depth\nTo understand what the client is doing in detail, it's important to\nunderstand the way it uses plugins.

Please update your client configurations to use this new endpoint.\n2019-10-09: LocalStack Pro is out! We're incredibly excited to announce the launch of LocalStack Pro - the enterprise version of LocalStack with additional APIs and advanced features. Check out the free trial at https:\/\/localstack.cloud\n2018-01-10: Help wanted! Please fill out this survey to support a research study on the usage of Serverless and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) services, conducted at the Chalmers University of Technology. The survey only takes 5-10 minutes of your time. Many thanks for your participation!!\n\nThe result from this study can be found here\n\n\n2017-08-27: We need your support! LocalStack is growing fast, we now have thousands of developers using the platform regularly. Last month we have recorded a staggering 100k test runs, with 25k+ DynamoDB tables, 20k+ SQS queues, 15k+ Kinesis streams, 13k+ S3 buckets, and 10k+ Lambda functions created locally - for 0$ costs (more details to be published soon). Bug and feature requests are pouring in, and we now need some support from you to keep the open-source version actively maintained. Please check out Open Collective and become a backer or supporter of the project today! Thanks, everybody for contributing. \u2665\n2017-07-20: Please note: Starting with version 0.7.0, the Docker image will be pushed\nand kept up to date under the new name localstack\/localstack. (This means that you may\nhave to update your CI configurations.) Please refer to the updated\nEnd-User License Agreement (EULA) for the new versions.\nThe old Docker image (atlassianlabs\/localstack) is still available but will not be maintained\nany longer.\n\nOverview\nLocalStack spins up the following core Cloud APIs on your local machine.\nNote: Starting with version 0.11.0, all APIs are exposed via a single edge service, which is\naccessible on http:\/\/localhost:4566 by default (customizable via EDGE_PORT, see further below).\n\nACM\nAPI Gateway\nCloudFormation\nCloudWatch\nCloudWatch Logs\nDynamoDB\nDynamoDB Streams\nEC2\nElasticsearch Service\nEventBridge (CloudWatch Events)\nFirehose\nIAM\nKinesis\nKMS\nLambda\nRedshift\nRoute53\nS3\nSecretsManager\nSES\nSNS\nSQS\nSSM\nStepFunctions\nSTS\n\nIn addition to the above, the Pro version of LocalStack supports additional APIs and advanced features, including:\n\nAmplify\nAPI Gateway V2 (WebSockets support)\nAppSync\nAthena\nCloudFront\nCloudTrail\nCognito\nECS\/ECR\/EKS\nElastiCache\nEMR\nGlacier \/ S3 Select\nIoT\nKinesis Data Analytics\nLambda Layers\nManaged Streaming for Kafka (MSK)\nMediaStore\nQLDB\nRDS\nTransfer\nXRay\nInteractive UIs to manage resources\nTest report dashboards\n...and much, much more to come!\n\nWhy LocalStack?\nLocalStack builds on existing best-of-breed mocking\/testing tools, notably\nkinesalite\/dynalite\nand moto, ElasticMQ,\nand others. While these tools are awesome (!), they lack functionality for certain use cases.\nLocalStack combines the tools, makes them interoperable, and adds important missing functionality\non top of them:\n\nError injection: LocalStack allows to inject errors frequently occurring in real Cloud environments,\nfor instance ProvisionedThroughputExceededException which is thrown by Kinesis or DynamoDB if the amount of\nread\/write throughput is exceeded.\nIsolated processes: Services in LocalStack can be run in separate processes.\nIn moto, components are often hard-wired in memory (e.g., when forwarding a message on an SNS topic to an\nSQS queue, the queue endpoint is looked up in a local hash map). In contrast, LocalStack services live in\nisolation (separate processes\/threads communicating via HTTP), which fosters true decoupling and more closely\nresembles the real cloud environment.\nPluggable services: All services in LocalStack are easily pluggable (and replaceable), due to the fact that\nwe are using isolated processes for each service. This allows us to keep the framework up-to-date and select\nbest-of-breed mocks for each individual service.\n\nRequirements\n\npython (both Python 2.x and 3.x supported)\npip (python package manager)\nDocker\n\nInstalling\nThe easiest way to install LocalStack is via pip:\npip install localstack\n\nNote: Please do not use sudo or the root user - LocalStack\nshould be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems\nwith permissions in MacOS X Sierra, install with pip install --user localstack\nRunning in Docker\nBy default, LocalStack gets started inside a Docker container using this command:\nlocalstack start\n\n(Note that on MacOS you may have to run TMPDIR=\/private$TMPDIR localstack start --docker if\n$TMPDIR contains a symbolic link that cannot be mounted by Docker.)\nNote: From 2020-07-11 onwards, the default image localstack\/localstack in Docker Hub refers to the \"light version\", which has some large dependency files like Elasticsearch removed (and lazily downloads them, if required). (Note that the localstack\/localstack-light image alias may get removed in the future). In case you need the full set of dependencies, the localstack\/localstack-full image can be used instead. Please also refer to the USE_LIGHT_IMAGE configuration below.\n(Note: Although it is strongly recommended to use Docker, the infrastructure can also be spun up directly on the host machine using the --host startup flag. Note that this will require additional dependencies, and is not supported on some operating systems, including Windows.)\nUsing docker-compose\nYou can also use the docker-compose.yml file from the repository and use this command (currently requires docker-compose version 1.9.0+):\ndocker-compose up\n\n(Note that on MacOS you may have to run TMPDIR=\/private$TMPDIR docker-compose up if\n$TMPDIR contains a symbolic link that cannot be mounted by Docker.)\nTo facilitate interoperability, configuration variables can be prefixed with LOCALSTACK_ in docker. For instance, setting LOCALSTACK_SERVICES=s3 is equivalent to SERVICES=s3.\nConfigurations\nYou can pass the following environment variables to LocalStack:\n\n\nEDGE_PORT: Port number for the edge service, the main entry point for all API invocations (default: 4566).\n\n\nSERVICES: Comma-separated list of service names (APIs) to start up. Service names basically correspond\nto the service names of the AWS CLI\n(kinesis, lambda, sqs, etc), although LocalStack only supports a subset of them.\nExample value: kinesis,lambda,sqs to start Kinesis, Lambda, and SQS.\nIn addition, the following shorthand values can be specified to run a predefined ensemble of services:\n\nserverless: run services often used for Serverless apps (iam, lambda, dynamodb, apigateway, s3, sns)\n\n\n\nDEFAULT_REGION: AWS region to use when talking to the API (default: us-east-1).\n\n\nHOSTNAME: Name of the host to expose the services internally (default: localhost).\nUse this to customize the framework-internal communication, e.g., if services are\nstarted in different containers using docker-compose.\n\n\nHOSTNAME_EXTERNAL: Name of the host to expose the services externally (default: localhost).\nThis host is used, e.g., when returning queue URLs from the SQS service to the client.\n\n\n<SERVICE>_PORT_EXTERNAL: Port number to expose a specific service externally (defaults to service ports above). SQS_PORT_EXTERNAL, for example, is used when returning queue URLs from the SQS service to the client.\n\n\nIMAGE_NAME: Specific name and tag of LocalStack Docker image to use, e.g., localstack\/localstack:0.11.0 (default: localstack\/localstack).\n\n\nUSE_LIGHT_IMAGE: Whether to use the light-weight Docker image (default: 1). Overwritten by IMAGE_NAME.\n\n\nKINESIS_ERROR_PROBABILITY: Decimal value between 0.0 (default) and 1.0 to randomly\ninject ProvisionedThroughputExceededException errors into Kinesis API responses.\n\n\nKINESIS_SHARD_LIMIT: Integer value (default: 100) or Infinity (to disable), causing the Kinesis API to start throwing exceptions to mimick the default shard limit.\n\n\nKINESIS_LATENCY: Integer value (default: 500) or 0 (to disable), causing the Kinesis API to delay returning a response in order to mimick latency from a live AWS call.\n\n\nDYNAMODB_ERROR_PROBABILITY: Decimal value between 0.0 (default) and 1.0 to randomly inject ProvisionedThroughputExceededException errors into DynamoDB API responses.\n\n\nDYNAMODB_HEAP_SIZE: Sets the JAVA EE maximum memory size for dynamodb values are (integer)m for MB, (integer)G for GB default(256m), full table scans require more memory\n\n\nSTEPFUNCTIONS_LAMBDA_ENDPOINT: URL to use as the Lambda service endpoint in Step Functions. By default this is the LocalStack Lambda endpoint. Use default to select the original AWS Lambda endpoint.\n\n\nLAMBDA_EXECUTOR: Method to use for executing Lambda functions. Possible values are:\n\nlocal: run Lambda functions in a temporary directory on the local machine\ndocker: run each function invocation in a separate Docker container\ndocker-reuse: create one Docker container per function and reuse it across invocations\n\nFor docker and docker-reuse, if LocalStack itself is started inside Docker, then\nthe docker command needs to be available inside the container (usually requires to run the\ncontainer in privileged mode). Default is docker, fallback to local if Docker is not available.\n\n\nLAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER determines whether Lambda code is copied or mounted into containers.\nPossible values are:\n\ntrue (default): your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by\ncopying the zip file (potentially slower). It allows for remote execution, where the host\nand the client are not on the same machine.\nfalse: your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by mounting a\nvolume (potentially faster). This requires to have the Docker client and the Docker\nhost on the same machine.\n\n\n\nLAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK: Optional Docker network for the container running your lambda function.\n\n\nLAMBDA_DOCKER_DNS: Optional DNS server for the container running your lambda function.\n\n\nLAMBDA_CONTAINER_REGISTRY Use an alternative docker registry to pull lambda execution containers (default: lambci\/lambda).\n\n\nLAMBDA_REMOVE_CONTAINERS: Whether to remove containers after Lambdas finished executing (default: true).\n\n\nDATA_DIR: Local directory for saving persistent data (currently only supported for these services:\nKinesis, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, S3, Secretsmanager, SSM, SQS, SNS). Set it to \/tmp\/localstack\/data to enable persistence\n(\/tmp\/localstack is mounted into the Docker container), leave blank to disable\npersistence (default).\n\n\nPORT_WEB_UI: Port for the Web user interface \/ dashboard (default: 8080). Note that the Web UI is now deprecated, and requires to use the localstack\/localstack-full Docker image.\n\n\n<SERVICE>_BACKEND: Custom endpoint URL to use for a specific service, where <SERVICE> is the uppercase\nservice name (currently works for: APIGATEWAY, CLOUDFORMATION, DYNAMODB, ELASTICSEARCH,\nKINESIS, S3, SNS, SQS). This allows to easily integrate third-party services into LocalStack.\n\n\nFORCE_NONINTERACTIVE: when running with Docker, disables the --interactive and --tty flags. Useful when running headless.\n\n\nDOCKER_FLAGS: Allows to pass custom flags (e.g., volume mounts) to \"docker run\" when running LocalStack in Docker.\n\n\nDOCKER_CMD: Shell command used to run Docker containers, e.g., set to \"sudo docker\" to run as sudo (default: docker).\n\n\nSKIP_INFRA_DOWNLOADS: Whether to skip downloading additional infrastructure components (e.g., specific Elasticsearch versions).\n\n\nSTART_WEB: Flag to control whether the Web UI should be started in Docker (values: 0\/1; default: 1).\n\n\nLAMBDA_FALLBACK_URL: Fallback URL to use when a non-existing Lambda is invoked. Either records invocations in DynamoDB (value dynamodb:\/\/<table_name>) or forwards invocations as a POST request (value http(s):\/\/...).\n\n\nEXTRA_CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS: Comma-separated list of header names to be be added to Access-Control-Allow-Headers CORS header\n\n\nEXTRA_CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS: Comma-separated list of header names to be be added to Access-Control-Expose-Headers CORS header\n\n\nLAMBDA_JAVA_OPTS: Allow passing custom JVM options (e.g., -Xmx512M) to Java Lambdas executed in Docker. Use _debug_port_ placeholder to configure the debug port (e.g., -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=_debug_port_).\n\n\nMAIN_CONTAINER_NAME: Specify the main docker container name (default: localstack_main).\n\n\nINIT_SCRIPTS_PATH: Specify the path to the initializing files with extensions .sh that are found default in \/docker-entrypoint-initaws.d.\n\n\nThe following environment configurations are deprecated:\n\nUSE_SSL: Whether to use https:\/\/... URLs with SSL encryption (default: false). Deprecated as of version 0.11.3 - each service endpoint now supports multiplexing HTTP\/HTTPS traffic over the same port.\n\nAdditionally, the following read-only environment variables are available:\n\nLOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME: Name of the host where LocalStack services are available.\nUse this hostname as endpoint (e.g., http:\/\/${LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME}:4566) in order\nto access the services from within your Lambda functions\n(e.g., to store an item to DynamoDB or S3 from a Lambda).\n\nAn example passing the above environment variables to LocalStack to start Kinesis, Lambda, Dynamodb and SQS:\nSERVICES=kinesis,lambda,sqs,dynamodb localstack start\n\nDynamically updating configuration at runtime\nEach of the service APIs listed above defines\na backdoor API under the path \/?_config_ which allows to dynamically update configuration variables\ndefined in config.py.\nFor example, to dynamically set KINESIS_ERROR_PROBABILITY=1 at runtime, use the following command:\ncurl -v -d '{\"variable\":\"KINESIS_ERROR_PROBABILITY\",\"value\":1}' 'http:\/\/localhost:4568\/?_config_'\n\nService health checks\nThe service \/health check endpoint on the edge port (http:\/\/localhost:4566\/health by default) provides basic information about the status of each service (e.g., {\"s3\":\"running\",\"es\":\"starting\"}). By default, the endpoint returns cached values that are determined during startup - the status values can be refreshed by adding the reload query parameter: http:\/\/localhost:4566\/health?reload.\nInitializing a fresh instance\nWhen a container is started for the first time, it will execute files with extensions .sh that are found in \/docker-entrypoint-initaws.d or an alternate path defined in INIT_SCRIPTS_PATH. Files will be executed in alphabetical order. You can easily create aws resources on localstack using awslocal (or aws) cli tool in the initialization scripts.\nUsing custom SSL certificates\nTo use your own SSL certificate instead of the randomly generated certificate, you can place a file server.test.pem into the LocalStack temporary directory ($TMPDIR\/localstack, or \/tmp\/localstack by default). The file server.test.pem must contain the key file, as well as the certificate file content:\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\nUsing custom SSL certificates with docker-compose\nTypically with docker-compose you can add into docker-compose.yml this volume to the LocalStack services :\n  volumes:\n    - \"${PWD}\/ls_tmp:\/tmp\/localstack\"\n    - \"\/var\/run\/docker.sock:\/var\/run\/docker.sock\"\n\nThe local directory \/ls_tmp must contains the three files (server.test.pem, server.test.pem.crt, server.test.pem.key)\nAccessing the infrastructure via CLI or code\nYou can point your aws CLI to use the local infrastructure, for example:\naws --endpoint-url=http:\/\/localhost:4568 kinesis list-streams\n{\n    \"StreamNames\": []\n}\n\nUse the below command to install aws CLI, if not installed already.\npip install awscli\n\nSetting up local region and credentials to run LocalStack\naws requires the region and the credentials to be set in order to run the aws commands. Create the default configuration & the credentials. Below key will ask for the Access key id, secret Access Key, region & output format.\naws configure --profile default\n\n# Config & credential file will be created under ~\/.aws folder\n\nNOTE: Please use test as Access key id and secret Access Key to make S3 presign url work. We have added presign url signature verification algorithm to validate the presign url and its expiration. You can configure credentials into the system environment using export command in the linux\/Mac system. You also can add credentials in ~\/.aws\/credentials file directly.\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test\n\nNEW: Check out awslocal, a thin CLI wrapper\nthat runs commands directly against LocalStack (no need to specify --endpoint-url anymore).\nInstall it via pip install awscli-local, and then use it as follows:\nawslocal kinesis list-streams\n{\n    \"StreamNames\": []\n}\n\nUPDATE: Use the environment variable $LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME to determine the target host\ninside your Lambda function. See Configurations section for more details.\nUsing the official AWS CLI version 2 Docker image with Localstack Docker container\nBy default the container running amazon\/aws-cli is isolated from 0.0.0.0:4566 on the host machine, that means that aws-cli cannot reach localstack through your shell.\nTo ensure that the two docker containers can communicate create a network on the docker engine:\n$ \u25b6 docker network create localstack\n0c9cb3d37b0ea1bfeb6b77ade0ce5525e33c7929d69f49c3e5ed0af457bdf123\nThen modify the docker-compose.yml specifying the network to use:\nnetworks:\n  default:\n    external:\n      name: \"localstack\"\nRun AWS Cli v2 docker container using this network (example):\n$ \u25b6 docker run --network localstack --rm -it amazon\/aws-cli --endpoint-url=http:\/\/localstack:4566 lambda list-functions\n{\n    \"Functions\": []\n}\nIf you use AWS CLI v2 from a docker container often, create an alias:\n$ \u25b6 alias laws='docker run --network localstack --rm -it amazon\/aws-cli --endpoint-url=http:\/\/localstack:4566'\nSo you can type:\n$ \u25b6 laws lambda list-functions\n{\n    \"Functions\": []\n}\nClient Libraries\n\nPython: https:\/\/github.com\/localstack\/localstack-python-client\n\nalternatively, you can also use boto3 and use the endpoint_url parameter when creating a connection\n\n\n(more coming soon...)\n\nInvoking API Gateway\nWhile API Gateway endpoints on AWS use a custom DNS name to identify the API ID (e.g., https:\/\/nmafetnwf6.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\/prod\/my\/path), LocalStack uses the special URL path indicator ...\/_user_request_\/... to indicate the execution of a REST API method.\nThe URL pattern for API Gateway executions is http:\/\/localhost:4566\/restapis\/<apiId>\/<stage>\/_user_request_\/<methodPath>. The example URL above would map to the following localhost URL:\n$ curl http:\/\/localhost:4566\/restapis\/nmafetnwf6\/prod\/_user_request_\/my\/path\n\nIntegration with nosetests\nIf you want to use LocalStack in your integration tests (e.g., nosetests), simply fire up the\ninfrastructure in your test setup method and then clean up everything in your teardown method:\nfrom localstack.services import infra\n\ndef setup():\n    infra.start_infra(asynchronous=True)\n\ndef teardown():\n    infra.stop_infra()\n\ndef my_app_test():\n    # here goes your test logic\n\nSee the example test file tests\/integration\/test_integration.py for more details.\nIntegration with Serverless\nYou can use the serverless-localstack plugin to easily run Serverless applications on LocalStack.\nFor more information, please check out the plugin repository here:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/localstack\/serverless-localstack\nIntegration with Terraform\nYou can use Terraform to provision your resources locally. Please refer to the Terraform AWS Provider docs here on how to configure the API endpoints on localhost.\nUsing local code with Lambda\nIn order to mount a local folder, ensure that LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER is set to false then set the S3 bucket name to __local__ and the S3 key to your local path:\nawslocal lambda create-function --function-name myLambda \\\n    --code S3Bucket=\"__local__\",S3Key=\"\/my\/local\/lambda\/folder\" \\\n    --handler index.myHandler \\\n    --runtime nodejs8.10 \\\n    --role whatever\n\nIntegration with Java\/JUnit\nIn order to use LocalStack with Java, the project ships with a simple JUnit runner, see sample below.\n...\nimport cloud.localstack.LocalstackTestRunner;\nimport cloud.localstack.TestUtils;\nimport cloud.localstack.docker.annotation.LocalstackDockerProperties;\n\n@RunWith(LocalstackTestRunner.class)\n@LocalstackDockerProperties(services = { \"s3\", \"sqs\", \"kinesis:77077\" })\npublic class MyCloudAppTest {\n\n  @Test\n  public void testLocalS3API() {\n    AmazonS3 s3 = TestUtils.getClientS3()\n    List<Bucket> buckets = s3.listBuckets();\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nFor more details and a complete list of configuration parameters, please refer to the LocalStack Java Utils repository.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf you're using AWS Java libraries with Kinesis, please, refer to CBOR protocol issues with the Java SDK guide how to disable CBOR protocol which is not supported by kinesalite.\n\n\nAccessing local S3: To avoid domain name resolution issues, you need to enable path style access on your S3 SDK client. Most AWS SDKs provide a config to achieve that, e.g., for Java:\n\n\ns3.setS3ClientOptions(S3ClientOptions.builder().setPathStyleAccess(true).build());\n\/\/ There is also an option to do this if you're using any of the client builder classes:\nAmazonS3ClientBuilder builder = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard();\nbuilder.withPathStyleAccessEnabled(true);\n...\n\n\n\nMounting the temp. directory: Note that on MacOS you may have to run TMPDIR=\/private$TMPDIR docker-compose up if\n$TMPDIR contains a symbolic link that cannot be mounted by Docker.\n(See details here: https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/atlassian\/localstack\/issues\/40\/getting-mounts-failed-on-docker-compose-up)\n\n\nIf you run into file permission issues on pip install under Mac OS (e.g., Permission denied: '\/Library\/Python\/2.7\/site-packages\/six.py'), then you may have to re-install pip via Homebrew (see this discussion thread). Alternatively, try installing\nwith the --user flag: pip install --user localstack\n\n\nIf you are deploying within OpenShift, please be aware: the pod must run as root, and the user must have capabilities added to the running pod, in order to allow Elasticsearch to be run as the non-root localstack user.\n\n\nIf you are experiencing slow performance with Lambdas in Mac OS, you could either (1) try mounting local code directly into the Lambda container, or (2) disable mounting the temporary directory into the LocalStack container in docker-compose. (See also https:\/\/github.com\/localstack\/localstack\/issues\/2515)\n\n\nThe environment variable no_proxy is rewritten by LocalStack. (Internal requests will go straight via localhost, bypassing any proxy configuration).\n\n\nFor troubleshooting LocalStack start issues, you can check debug logs by running DEBUG=1 localstack start\n\n\nIn case you get errors related to node\/nodejs, you may find (this issue comment: https:\/\/github.com\/localstack\/localstack\/issues\/227#issuecomment-319938530) helpful.\n\n\nIf you are using AWS Java libraries and need to disable SSL certificate checking, add -Dcom.amazonaws.sdk.disableCertChecking to the java invocation.\n\n\nDeveloping\nRequirements for developing or starting locally\nTo develop new features, or to start the stack locally (outside of Docker), the following additional tools are required:\n\nmake\nnpm (node.js package manager)\njava\/javac (Java 8 runtime environment and compiler)\nmvn (Maven, the build system for Java)\nmoto(for testing)\ndocker-compose (for running the localstack using docker-compose)\nmock (for unit testing)\npytest (for unit testing)\npytest-cov (to check the unit-testing coverage)\n\nDevelopment Environment\nIf you pull the repo in order to extend\/modify LocalStack, run this command to install\nall the dependencies:\nmake install\n\nThis will install the required pip dependencies in a local Python virtualenv directory\n.venv (your global python packages will remain untouched), as well as some node modules\nin .\/localstack\/node_modules\/. Depending on your system, some pip\/npm modules may require\nadditional native libs installed.\nThe Makefile contains a target to conveniently run the local infrastructure for development:\nmake infra\n\nCheck out the\ndeveloper guide which\ncontains a few instructions on how to get started with developing (and debugging) features for\nLocalStack.\nTesting\nThe project contains a set of unit and integration tests that can be kicked off via a make\ntarget:\nmake test\n\nTo check the Code Coverage\nOnce the new feature \/ bug fix is done, run the unit testing and check for the coverage.\n# To run the particular test file (sample)\npytest --cov=localstack tests\/unit\/test_common.py\n\n# To check the coverage in the console\ncoverage report\n\n# To check the coverage as html (output will be redirected to the html folder)\ncoverage html\n\nWeb Dashboard (deprecated)\nThe projects also comes with a simple Web dashboard that allows to view the deployed AWS\ncomponents and the relationship between them.\nlocalstack web\n\nPlease note that the Web UI requires using the extended version of the Docker image (localstack\/localstack-full).\nNote: The Web dashboard is not actively maintained anymore and may get removed in an upcoming release.\nOther UI Clients\n\nCommandeer desktop app\nDynamoDB Admin Web UI\n\nChange Log\nPlease refer to CHANGELOG.md to see the complete list of changes for each release.\nContributing\nWe welcome feedback, bug reports, and pull requests!\nFor pull requests, please stick to the following guidelines:\n\nAdd tests for any new features and bug fixes. Ideally, each PR should increase the test coverage.\nFollow the existing code style (e.g., indents). A PEP8 code linting target is included in the Makefile.\nPut a reasonable amount of comments into the code.\nFork localstack on your github user account, do your changes there and then create a PR against main localstack repository.\nSeparate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests.\n1 commit per PR: Please squash\/rebase multiple commits into one single commit (to keep the history clean).\n\nPlease note that by contributing any code or documentation to this repository (by\nraising pull requests, or otherwise) you explicitly agree to\nthe Contributor License Agreement.\nContributors\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.\n\nBackers\nThank you to all our backers! \ud83d\ude4f [Become a backer]\n\nSponsors\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis \/ manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\nMain Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\nEasy handling of missing data (represented as\nNaN, NA, or NaT) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\nSize mutability: columns can be inserted and\ndeleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional\nobjects\nAutomatic and explicit data alignment: objects can\nbe explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\nignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically\nalign the data for you in computations\nPowerful, flexible group by functionality to perform\nsplit-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\nand transforming data\nMake it easy to convert ragged,\ndifferently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\ninto DataFrame objects\nIntelligent label-based slicing, fancy\nindexing, and subsetting of\nlarge data sets\nIntuitive merging and joining data\nsets\nFlexible reshaping and pivoting of\ndata sets\nHierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\nlabels per tick)\nRobust IO tools for loading data from flat files\n(CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases,\nand saving\/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\nTime series-specific functionality: date range\ngeneration and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\ndate shifting and lagging.\n\nWhere to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/pandas-dev\/pandas\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python\npackage index and on conda.\n# conda\nconda install pandas\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\nDependencies\n\nNumPy\npython-dateutil\npytz\n\nSee the full installation instructions for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.\nInstallation from sources\nTo install pandas from source you need Cython in addition to the normal\ndependencies above. Cython can be installed from pypi:\npip install cython\nIn the pandas directory (same one where you found this file after\ncloning the git repo), execute:\npython setup.py install\nor for installing in development mode:\npython -m pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --no-use-pep517\nIf you have make, you can also use make develop to run the same command.\nor alternatively\npython setup.py develop\nSee the full instructions for installing from source.\nLicense\nBSD 3\nDocumentation\nThe official documentation is hosted on PyData.org: https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\nBackground\nWork on pandas started at AQR (a quantitative hedge fund) in 2008 and\nhas been under active development since then.\nGetting Help\nFor usage questions, the best place to go to is StackOverflow.\nFurther, general questions and discussions can also take place on the pydata mailing list.\nDiscussion and Development\nMost development discussions take place on github in this repo. Further, the pandas-dev mailing list can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a Gitter channel is available for quick development related questions.\nContributing to pandas \nAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.\nA detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the contributing guide. There is also an overview on GitHub.\nIf you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the GitHub \"issues\" tab and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under Docs and good first issue where you could start out.\nYou can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage.\nOr maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking \u2018this can be improved\u2019...you can do something about it!\nFeel free to ask questions on the mailing list or on Gitter.\nAs contributors and maintainers to this project, you are expected to abide by pandas' code of conduct.

The smaller BERT models are intended for environments with restricted computational resources. They can be fine-tuned in the same manner as the original BERT models. However, they are most effective in the context of knowledge distillation, where the fine-tuning labels are produced by a larger and more accurate teacher.\nOur goal is to enable research in institutions with fewer computational resources and encourage the community to seek directions of innovation alternative to increasing model capacity.\nYou can download all 24 from here, or individually from the table below:\n\n\n\n\nH=128\nH=256\nH=512\nH=768\n\n\n\n\nL=2\n2\/128 (BERT-Tiny)\n2\/256\n2\/512\n2\/768\n\n\nL=4\n4\/128\n4\/256 (BERT-Mini)\n4\/512 (BERT-Small)\n4\/768\n\n\nL=6\n6\/128\n6\/256\n6\/512\n6\/768\n\n\nL=8\n8\/128\n8\/256\n8\/512 (BERT-Medium)\n8\/768\n\n\nL=10\n10\/128\n10\/256\n10\/512\n10\/768\n\n\nL=12\n12\/128\n12\/256\n12\/512\n12\/768 (BERT-Base)\n\n\n\nNote that the BERT-Base model in this release is included for completeness only; it was re-trained under the same regime as the original model.\nHere are the corresponding GLUE scores on the test set:\n\n\n\nModel\nScore\nCoLA\nSST-2\nMRPC\nSTS-B\nQQP\nMNLI-m\nMNLI-mm\nQNLI(v2)\nRTE\nWNLI\nAX\n\n\n\n\nBERT-Tiny\n64.2\n0.0\n83.2\n81.1\/71.1\n74.3\/73.6\n62.2\/83.4\n70.2\n70.3\n81.5\n57.2\n62.3\n21.0\n\n\nBERT-Mini\n65.8\n0.0\n85.9\n81.1\/71.8\n75.4\/73.3\n66.4\/86.2\n74.8\n74.3\n84.1\n57.9\n62.3\n26.1\n\n\nBERT-Small\n71.2\n27.8\n89.7\n83.4\/76.2\n78.8\/77.0\n68.1\/87.0\n77.6\n77.0\n86.4\n61.8\n62.3\n28.6\n\n\nBERT-Medium\n73.5\n38.0\n89.6\n86.6\/81.6\n80.4\/78.4\n69.6\/87.9\n80.0\n79.1\n87.7\n62.2\n62.3\n30.5\n\n\n\nFor each task, we selected the best fine-tuning hyperparameters from the lists below, and trained for 4 epochs:\n\nbatch sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128\nlearning rates: 3e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5, 3e-5\n\nIf you use these models, please cite the following paper:\n@article{turc2019,\n  title={Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre-training Compact Models},\n  author={Turc, Iulia and Chang, Ming-Wei and Lee, Kenton and Toutanova, Kristina},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.08962v2 },\n  year={2019}\n}\n\n***** New May 31st, 2019: Whole Word Masking Models *****\nThis is a release of several new models which were the result of an improvement\nthe pre-processing code.\nIn the original pre-processing code, we randomly select WordPiece tokens to\nmask. For example:\nInput Text: the man jumped up , put his basket on phil ##am ##mon ' s head\nOriginal Masked Input: [MASK] man [MASK] up , put his [MASK] on phil [MASK] ##mon ' s head\nThe new technique is called Whole Word Masking. In this case, we always mask\nall of the the tokens corresponding to a word at once. The overall masking\nrate remains the same.\nWhole Word Masked Input: the man [MASK] up , put his basket on [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] ' s head\nThe training is identical -- we still predict each masked WordPiece token\nindependently. The improvement comes from the fact that the original prediction\ntask was too 'easy' for words that had been split into multiple WordPieces.\nThis can be enabled during data generation by passing the flag\n--do_whole_word_mask=True to create_pretraining_data.py.\nPre-trained models with Whole Word Masking are linked below. The data and\ntraining were otherwise identical, and the models have identical structure and\nvocab to the original models. We only include BERT-Large models.

SOTA)\n82.2\n88.1\n75.0\n\n\n\nPlus many other tasks.\nMoreover, these results were all obtained with almost no task-specific neural\nnetwork architecture design.\nIf you already know what BERT is and you just want to get started, you can\ndownload the pre-trained models and\nrun a state-of-the-art fine-tuning in only a few\nminutes.\nWhat is BERT?\nBERT is a method of pre-training language representations, meaning that we train\na general-purpose \"language understanding\" model on a large text corpus (like\nWikipedia), and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks that we care about\n(like question answering). BERT outperforms previous methods because it is the\nfirst unsupervised, deeply bidirectional system for pre-training NLP.\nUnsupervised means that BERT was trained using only a plain text corpus, which\nis important because an enormous amount of plain text data is publicly available\non the web in many languages.\nPre-trained representations can also either be context-free or contextual,\nand contextual representations can further be unidirectional or\nbidirectional. Context-free models such as\nword2vec or\nGloVe generate a single \"word\nembedding\" representation for each word in the vocabulary, so bank would have\nthe same representation in bank deposit and river bank. Contextual models\ninstead generate a representation of each word that is based on the other words\nin the sentence.\nBERT was built upon recent work in pre-training contextual representations \u2014\nincluding Semi-supervised Sequence Learning,\nGenerative Pre-Training,\nELMo, and\nULMFit\n\u2014 but crucially these models are all unidirectional or shallowly\nbidirectional. This means that each word is only contextualized using the words\nto its left (or right). For example, in the sentence I made a bank deposit the\nunidirectional representation of bank is only based on I made a but not\ndeposit. Some previous work does combine the representations from separate\nleft-context and right-context models, but only in a \"shallow\" manner. BERT\nrepresents \"bank\" using both its left and right context \u2014 I made a ... deposit\n\u2014 starting from the very bottom of a deep neural network, so it is deeply\nbidirectional.\nBERT uses a simple approach for this: We mask out 15% of the words in the input,\nrun the entire sequence through a deep bidirectional\nTransformer encoder, and then predict only\nthe masked words. For example:\nInput: the man went to the [MASK1] . he bought a [MASK2] of milk.\nLabels: [MASK1] = store; [MASK2] = gallon\n\nIn order to learn relationships between sentences, we also train on a simple\ntask which can be generated from any monolingual corpus: Given two sentences A\nand B, is B the actual next sentence that comes after A, or just a random\nsentence from the corpus?\nSentence A: the man went to the store .\nSentence B: he bought a gallon of milk .\nLabel: IsNextSentence\n\nSentence A: the man went to the store .\nSentence B: penguins are flightless .\nLabel: NotNextSentence\n\nWe then train a large model (12-layer to 24-layer Transformer) on a large corpus\n(Wikipedia + BookCorpus) for a long time (1M\nupdate steps), and that's BERT.\nUsing BERT has two stages: Pre-training and fine-tuning.\nPre-training is fairly expensive (four days on 4 to 16 Cloud TPUs), but is a\none-time procedure for each language (current models are English-only, but\nmultilingual models will be released in the near future). We are releasing a\nnumber of pre-trained models from the paper which were pre-trained at Google.\nMost NLP researchers will never need to pre-train their own model from scratch.\nFine-tuning is inexpensive. All of the results in the paper can be\nreplicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU,\nstarting from the exact same pre-trained model. SQuAD, for example, can be\ntrained in around 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev F1 score of\n91.0%, which is the single system state-of-the-art.\nThe other important aspect of BERT is that it can be adapted to many types of\nNLP tasks very easily. In the paper, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on\nsentence-level (e.g., SST-2), sentence-pair-level (e.g., MultiNLI), word-level\n(e.g., NER), and span-level (e.g., SQuAD) tasks with almost no task-specific\nmodifications.\nWhat has been released in this repository?\nWe are releasing the following:\n\nTensorFlow code for the BERT model architecture (which is mostly a standard\nTransformer architecture).\nPre-trained checkpoints for both the lowercase and cased version of\nBERT-Base and BERT-Large from the paper.\nTensorFlow code for push-button replication of the most important\nfine-tuning experiments from the paper, including SQuAD, MultiNLI, and MRPC.\n\nAll of the code in this repository works out-of-the-box with CPU, GPU, and Cloud\nTPU.\nPre-trained models\nWe are releasing the BERT-Base and BERT-Large models from the paper.\nUncased means that the text has been lowercased before WordPiece tokenization,\ne.g., John Smith becomes john smith. The Uncased model also strips out any\naccent markers. Cased means that the true case and accent markers are\npreserved. Typically, the Uncased model is better unless you know that case\ninformation is important for your task (e.g., Named Entity Recognition or\nPart-of-Speech tagging).\nThese models are all released under the same license as the source code (Apache\n2.0).\nFor information about the Multilingual and Chinese model, see the\nMultilingual README.\nWhen using a cased model, make sure to pass --do_lower=False to the training\nscripts. (Or pass do_lower_case=False directly to FullTokenizer if you're\nusing your own script.)\nThe links to the models are here (right-click, 'Save link as...' on the name):\n\nBERT-Large, Uncased (Whole Word Masking):\n24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters\nBERT-Large, Cased (Whole Word Masking):\n24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters\nBERT-Base, Uncased:\n12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters\nBERT-Large, Uncased:\n24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters\nBERT-Base, Cased:\n12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads , 110M parameters\nBERT-Large, Cased:\n24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters\nBERT-Base, Multilingual Cased (New, recommended):\n104 languages, 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters\nBERT-Base, Multilingual Uncased (Orig, not recommended)\n(Not recommended, use Multilingual Cased instead): 102 languages,\n12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters\nBERT-Base, Chinese:\nChinese Simplified and Traditional, 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M\nparameters\n\nEach .zip file contains three items:\n\nA TensorFlow checkpoint (bert_model.ckpt) containing the pre-trained\nweights (which is actually 3 files).\nA vocab file (vocab.txt) to map WordPiece to word id.\nA config file (bert_config.json) which specifies the hyperparameters of\nthe model.\n\nFine-tuning with BERT\nImportant: All results on the paper were fine-tuned on a single Cloud TPU,\nwhich has 64GB of RAM. It is currently not possible to re-produce most of the\nBERT-Large results on the paper using a GPU with 12GB - 16GB of RAM, because\nthe maximum batch size that can fit in memory is too small. We are working on\nadding code to this repository which allows for much larger effective batch size\non the GPU. See the section on out-of-memory issues for\nmore details.\nThis code was tested with TensorFlow 1.11.0. It was tested with Python2 and\nPython3 (but more thoroughly with Python2, since this is what's used internally\nin Google).\nThe fine-tuning examples which use BERT-Base should be able to run on a GPU\nthat has at least 12GB of RAM using the hyperparameters given.\nFine-tuning with Cloud TPUs\nMost of the examples below assumes that you will be running training\/evaluation\non your local machine, using a GPU like a Titan X or GTX 1080.\nHowever, if you have access to a Cloud TPU that you want to train on, just add\nthe following flags to run_classifier.py or run_squad.py:\n  --use_tpu=True \\\n  --tpu_name=$TPU_NAME\n\nPlease see the\nGoogle Cloud TPU tutorial\nfor how to use Cloud TPUs. Alternatively, you can use the Google Colab notebook\n\"BERT FineTuning with Cloud TPUs\".\nOn Cloud TPUs, the pretrained model and the output directory will need to be on\nGoogle Cloud Storage. For example, if you have a bucket named some_bucket, you\nmight use the following flags instead:\n  --output_dir=gs:\/\/some_bucket\/my_output_dir\/\n\nThe unzipped pre-trained model files can also be found in the Google Cloud\nStorage folder gs:\/\/bert_models\/2018_10_18. For example:\nexport BERT_BASE_DIR=gs:\/\/bert_models\/2018_10_18\/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12\n\nSentence (and sentence-pair) classification tasks\nBefore running this example you must download the\nGLUE data by running\nthis script\nand unpack it to some directory $GLUE_DIR. Next, download the BERT-Base\ncheckpoint and unzip it to some directory $BERT_BASE_DIR.\nThis example code fine-tunes BERT-Base on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase\nCorpus (MRPC) corpus, which only contains 3,600 examples and can fine-tune in a\nfew minutes on most GPUs.\nexport BERT_BASE_DIR=\/path\/to\/bert\/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12\nexport GLUE_DIR=\/path\/to\/glue\n\npython run_classifier.py \\\n  --task_name=MRPC \\\n  --do_train=true \\\n  --do_eval=true \\\n  --data_dir=$GLUE_DIR\/MRPC \\\n  --vocab_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/vocab.txt \\\n  --bert_config_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_config.json \\\n  --init_checkpoint=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_model.ckpt \\\n  --max_seq_length=128 \\\n  --train_batch_size=32 \\\n  --learning_rate=2e-5 \\\n  --num_train_epochs=3.0 \\\n  --output_dir=\/tmp\/mrpc_output\/\nYou should see output like this:\n***** Eval results *****\n  eval_accuracy = 0.845588\n  eval_loss = 0.505248\n  global_step = 343\n  loss = 0.505248\n\nThis means that the Dev set accuracy was 84.55%. Small sets like MRPC have a\nhigh variance in the Dev set accuracy, even when starting from the same\npre-training checkpoint. If you re-run multiple times (making sure to point to\ndifferent output_dir), you should see results between 84% and 88%.\nA few other pre-trained models are implemented off-the-shelf in\nrun_classifier.py, so it should be straightforward to follow those examples to\nuse BERT for any single-sentence or sentence-pair classification task.\nNote: You might see a message Running train on CPU. This really just means\nthat it's running on something other than a Cloud TPU, which includes a GPU.\nPrediction from classifier\nOnce you have trained your classifier you can use it in inference mode by using\nthe --do_predict=true command. You need to have a file named test.tsv in the\ninput folder. Output will be created in file called test_results.tsv in the\noutput folder.

BERT (at the time of the release) obtains state-of-the-art\nresults on SQuAD with almost no task-specific network architecture modifications\nor data augmentation. However, it does require semi-complex data pre-processing\nand post-processing to deal with (a) the variable-length nature of SQuAD context\nparagraphs, and (b) the character-level answer annotations which are used for\nSQuAD training. This processing is implemented and documented in run_squad.py.\nTo run on SQuAD, you will first need to download the dataset. The\nSQuAD website does not seem to\nlink to the v1.1 datasets any longer, but the necessary files can be found here:\n\ntrain-v1.1.json\ndev-v1.1.json\nevaluate-v1.1.py\n\nDownload these to some directory $SQUAD_DIR.\nThe state-of-the-art SQuAD results from the paper currently cannot be reproduced\non a 12GB-16GB GPU due to memory constraints (in fact, even batch size 1 does\nnot seem to fit on a 12GB GPU using BERT-Large). However, a reasonably strong\nBERT-Base model can be trained on the GPU with these hyperparameters:\npython run_squad.py \\\n  --vocab_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/vocab.txt \\\n  --bert_config_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_config.json \\\n  --init_checkpoint=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_model.ckpt \\\n  --do_train=True \\\n  --train_file=$SQUAD_DIR\/train-v1.1.json \\\n  --do_predict=True \\\n  --predict_file=$SQUAD_DIR\/dev-v1.1.json \\\n  --train_batch_size=12 \\\n  --learning_rate=3e-5 \\\n  --num_train_epochs=2.0 \\\n  --max_seq_length=384 \\\n  --doc_stride=128 \\\n  --output_dir=\/tmp\/squad_base\/\nThe dev set predictions will be saved into a file called predictions.json in\nthe output_dir:\npython $SQUAD_DIR\/evaluate-v1.1.py $SQUAD_DIR\/dev-v1.1.json .\/squad\/predictions.json\nWhich should produce an output like this:\n{\"f1\": 88.41249612335034, \"exact_match\": 81.2488174077578}\nYou should see a result similar to the 88.5% reported in the paper for\nBERT-Base.\nIf you have access to a Cloud TPU, you can train with BERT-Large.

Therefore, when using a GPU with 12GB - 16GB of RAM, you are likely\nto encounter out-of-memory issues if you use the same hyperparameters described\nin the paper.\nThe factors that affect memory usage are:\n\n\nmax_seq_length: The released models were trained with sequence lengths\nup to 512, but you can fine-tune with a shorter max sequence length to save\nsubstantial memory. This is controlled by the max_seq_length flag in our\nexample code.\n\n\ntrain_batch_size: The memory usage is also directly proportional to\nthe batch size.\n\n\nModel type, BERT-Base vs. BERT-Large: The BERT-Large model\nrequires significantly more memory than BERT-Base.\n\n\nOptimizer: The default optimizer for BERT is Adam, which requires a lot\nof extra memory to store the m and v vectors. Switching to a more memory\nefficient optimizer can reduce memory usage, but can also affect the\nresults. We have not experimented with other optimizers for fine-tuning.\n\n\nUsing the default training scripts (run_classifier.py and run_squad.py), we\nbenchmarked the maximum batch size on single Titan X GPU (12GB RAM) with\nTensorFlow 1.11.0:\n\n\n\nSystem\nSeq Length\nMax Batch Size\n\n\n\n\nBERT-Base\n64\n64\n\n\n...\n128\n32\n\n\n...\n256\n16\n\n\n...\n320\n14\n\n\n...\n384\n12\n\n\n...\n512\n6\n\n\nBERT-Large\n64\n12\n\n\n...\n128\n6\n\n\n...\n256\n2\n\n\n...\n320\n1\n\n\n...\n384\n0\n\n\n...\n512\n0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, these max batch sizes for BERT-Large are so small that they\nwill actually harm the model accuracy, regardless of the learning rate used. We\nare working on adding code to this repository which will allow much larger\neffective batch sizes to be used on the GPU. The code will be based on one (or\nboth) of the following techniques:\n\n\nGradient accumulation: The samples in a minibatch are typically\nindependent with respect to gradient computation (excluding batch\nnormalization, which is not used here). This means that the gradients of\nmultiple smaller minibatches can be accumulated before performing the weight\nupdate, and this will be exactly equivalent to a single larger update.\n\n\nGradient checkpointing:\nThe major use of GPU\/TPU memory during DNN training is caching the\nintermediate activations in the forward pass that are necessary for\nefficient computation in the backward pass. \"Gradient checkpointing\" trades\nmemory for compute time by re-computing the activations in an intelligent\nway.\n\n\nHowever, this is not implemented in the current release.\nUsing BERT to extract fixed feature vectors (like ELMo)\nIn certain cases, rather than fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model\nend-to-end, it can be beneficial to obtained pre-trained contextual\nembeddings, which are fixed contextual representations of each input token\ngenerated from the hidden layers of the pre-trained model. This should also\nmitigate most of the out-of-memory issues.\nAs an example, we include the script extract_features.py which can be used\nlike this:\n# Sentence A and Sentence B are separated by the ||| delimiter for sentence\n# pair tasks like question answering and entailment.\n# For single sentence inputs, put one sentence per line and DON'T use the\n# delimiter.\necho 'Who was Jim Henson ? ||| Jim Henson was a puppeteer' > \/tmp\/input.txt\n\npython extract_features.py \\\n  --input_file=\/tmp\/input.txt \\\n  --output_file=\/tmp\/output.jsonl \\\n  --vocab_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/vocab.txt \\\n  --bert_config_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_config.json \\\n  --init_checkpoint=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_model.ckpt \\\n  --layers=-1,-2,-3,-4 \\\n  --max_seq_length=128 \\\n  --batch_size=8\nThis will create a JSON file (one line per line of input) containing the BERT\nactivations from each Transformer layer specified by layers (-1 is the final\nhidden layer of the Transformer, etc.)\nNote that this script will produce very large output files (by default, around\n15kb for every input token).\nIf you need to maintain alignment between the original and tokenized words (for\nprojecting training labels), see the Tokenization section\nbelow.\nNote: You may see a message like Could not find trained model in model_dir: \/tmp\/tmpuB5g5c, running initialization to predict. This message is expected, it\njust means that we are using the init_from_checkpoint() API rather than the\nsaved model API. If you don't specify a checkpoint or specify an invalid\ncheckpoint, this script will complain.\nTokenization\nFor sentence-level tasks (or sentence-pair) tasks, tokenization is very simple.\nJust follow the example code in run_classifier.py and extract_features.py.\nThe basic procedure for sentence-level tasks is:\n\n\nInstantiate an instance of tokenizer = tokenization.FullTokenizer\n\n\nTokenize the raw text with tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(raw_text).\n\n\nTruncate to the maximum sequence length. (You can use up to 512, but you\nprobably want to use shorter if possible for memory and speed reasons.)\n\n\nAdd the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens in the right place.\n\n\nWord-level and span-level tasks (e.g., SQuAD and NER) are more complex, since\nyou need to maintain alignment between your input text and output text so that\nyou can project your training labels. SQuAD is a particularly complex example\nbecause the input labels are character-based, and SQuAD paragraphs are often\nlonger than our maximum sequence length. See the code in run_squad.py to show\nhow we handle this.\nBefore we describe the general recipe for handling word-level tasks, it's\nimportant to understand what exactly our tokenizer is doing. It has three main\nsteps:\n\n\nText normalization: Convert all whitespace characters to spaces, and\n(for the Uncased model) lowercase the input and strip out accent markers.\nE.g., John Johanson's, \u2192 john johanson's,.\n\n\nPunctuation splitting: Split all punctuation characters on both sides\n(i.e., add whitespace around all punctuation characters). Punctuation\ncharacters are defined as (a) Anything with a P* Unicode class, (b) any\nnon-letter\/number\/space ASCII character (e.g., characters like $ which are\ntechnically not punctuation). E.g., john johanson's, \u2192 john johanson ' s ,\n\n\nWordPiece tokenization: Apply whitespace tokenization to the output of\nthe above procedure, and apply\nWordPiece\ntokenization to each token separately. (Our implementation is directly based\non the one from tensor2tensor, which is linked). E.g., john johanson ' s , \u2192 john johan ##son ' s ,\n\n\nThe advantage of this scheme is that it is \"compatible\" with most existing\nEnglish tokenizers. For example, imagine that you have a part-of-speech tagging\ntask which looks like this:\nInput:  John Johanson 's   house\nLabels: NNP  NNP      POS NN\n\nThe tokenized output will look like this:\nTokens: john johan ##son ' s house\n\nCrucially, this would be the same output as if the raw text were John Johanson's house (with no space before the 's).\nIf you have a pre-tokenized representation with word-level annotations, you can\nsimply tokenize each input word independently, and deterministically maintain an\noriginal-to-tokenized alignment:\n### Input\norig_tokens = [\"John\", \"Johanson\", \"'s\",  \"house\"]\nlabels      = [\"NNP\",  \"NNP\",      \"POS\", \"NN\"]\n\n### Output\nbert_tokens = []\n\n# Token map will be an int -> int mapping between the `orig_tokens` index and\n# the `bert_tokens` index.\norig_to_tok_map = []\n\ntokenizer = tokenization.FullTokenizer(\n    vocab_file=vocab_file, do_lower_case=True)\n\nbert_tokens.append(\"[CLS]\")\nfor orig_token in orig_tokens:\n  orig_to_tok_map.append(len(bert_tokens))\n  bert_tokens.extend(tokenizer.tokenize(orig_token))\nbert_tokens.append(\"[SEP]\")\n\n# bert_tokens == [\"[CLS]\", \"john\", \"johan\", \"##son\", \"'\", \"s\", \"house\", \"[SEP]\"]\n# orig_to_tok_map == [1, 2, 4, 6]\nNow orig_to_tok_map can be used to project labels to the tokenized\nrepresentation.\nThere are common English tokenization schemes which will cause a slight mismatch\nbetween how BERT was pre-trained. For example, if your input tokenization splits\noff contractions like do n't, this will cause a mismatch. If it is possible to\ndo so, you should pre-process your data to convert these back to raw-looking\ntext, but if it's not possible, this mismatch is likely not a big deal.\nPre-training with BERT\nWe are releasing code to do \"masked LM\" and \"next sentence prediction\" on an\narbitrary text corpus. Note that this is not the exact code that was used for\nthe paper (the original code was written in C++, and had some additional\ncomplexity), but this code does generate pre-training data as described in the\npaper.\nHere's how to run the data generation. The input is a plain text file, with one\nsentence per line. (It is important that these be actual sentences for the \"next\nsentence prediction\" task). Documents are delimited by empty lines. The output\nis a set of tf.train.Examples serialized into TFRecord file format.\nYou can perform sentence segmentation with an off-the-shelf NLP toolkit such as\nspaCy. The create_pretraining_data.py script will\nconcatenate segments until they reach the maximum sequence length to minimize\ncomputational waste from padding (see the script for more details). However, you\nmay want to intentionally add a slight amount of noise to your input data (e.g.,\nrandomly truncate 2% of input segments) to make it more robust to non-sentential\ninput during fine-tuning.\nThis script stores all of the examples for the entire input file in memory, so\nfor large data files you should shard the input file and call the script\nmultiple times. (You can pass in a file glob to run_pretraining.py, e.g.,\ntf_examples.tf_record*.)\nThe max_predictions_per_seq is the maximum number of masked LM predictions per\nsequence. You should set this to around max_seq_length * masked_lm_prob (the\nscript doesn't do that automatically because the exact value needs to be passed\nto both scripts).\npython create_pretraining_data.py \\\n  --input_file=.\/sample_text.txt \\\n  --output_file=\/tmp\/tf_examples.tfrecord \\\n  --vocab_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/vocab.txt \\\n  --do_lower_case=True \\\n  --max_seq_length=128 \\\n  --max_predictions_per_seq=20 \\\n  --masked_lm_prob=0.15 \\\n  --random_seed=12345 \\\n  --dupe_factor=5\nHere's how to run the pre-training. Do not include init_checkpoint if you are\npre-training from scratch. The model configuration (including vocab size) is\nspecified in bert_config_file. This demo code only pre-trains for a small\nnumber of steps (20), but in practice you will probably want to set\nnum_train_steps to 10000 steps or more. The max_seq_length and\nmax_predictions_per_seq parameters passed to run_pretraining.py must be the\nsame as create_pretraining_data.py.\npython run_pretraining.py \\\n  --input_file=\/tmp\/tf_examples.tfrecord \\\n  --output_dir=\/tmp\/pretraining_output \\\n  --do_train=True \\\n  --do_eval=True \\\n  --bert_config_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_config.json \\\n  --init_checkpoint=$BERT_BASE_DIR\/bert_model.ckpt \\\n  --train_batch_size=32 \\\n  --max_seq_length=128 \\\n  --max_predictions_per_seq=20 \\\n  --num_train_steps=20 \\\n  --num_warmup_steps=10 \\\n  --learning_rate=2e-5\nThis will produce an output like this:\n***** Eval results *****\n  global_step = 20\n  loss = 0.0979674\n  masked_lm_accuracy = 0.985479\n  masked_lm_loss = 0.0979328\n  next_sentence_accuracy = 1.0\n  next_sentence_loss = 3.45724e-05\n\nNote that since our sample_text.txt file is very small, this example training\nwill overfit that data in only a few steps and produce unrealistically high\naccuracy numbers.\nPre-training tips and caveats\n\nIf using your own vocabulary, make sure to change vocab_size in\nbert_config.json. If you use a larger vocabulary without changing this,\nyou will likely get NaNs when training on GPU or TPU due to unchecked\nout-of-bounds access.\nIf your task has a large domain-specific corpus available (e.g., \"movie\nreviews\" or \"scientific papers\"), it will likely be beneficial to run\nadditional steps of pre-training on your corpus, starting from the BERT\ncheckpoint.\nThe learning rate we used in the paper was 1e-4. However, if you are doing\nadditional steps of pre-training starting from an existing BERT checkpoint,\nyou should use a smaller learning rate (e.g., 2e-5).\nCurrent BERT models are English-only, but we do plan to release a\nmultilingual model which has been pre-trained on a lot of languages in the\nnear future (hopefully by the end of November 2018).\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expensive because attention is\nquadratic to the sequence length. In other words, a batch of 64 sequences of\nlength 512 is much more expensive than a batch of 256 sequences of\nlength 128. The fully-connected\/convolutional cost is the same, but the\nattention cost is far greater for the 512-length sequences. Therefore, one\ngood recipe is to pre-train for, say, 90,000 steps with a sequence length of\n128 and then for 10,000 additional steps with a sequence length of 512. The\nvery long sequences are mostly needed to learn positional embeddings, which\ncan be learned fairly quickly. Note that this does require generating the\ndata twice with different values of max_seq_length.\nIf you are pre-training from scratch, be prepared that pre-training is\ncomputationally expensive, especially on GPUs. If you are pre-training from\nscratch, our recommended recipe is to pre-train a BERT-Base on a single\npreemptible Cloud TPU v2, which\ntakes about 2 weeks at a cost of about $500 USD (based on the pricing in\nOctober 2018). You will have to scale down the batch size when only training\non a single Cloud TPU, compared to what was used in the paper. It is\nrecommended to use the largest batch size that fits into TPU memory.\n\nPre-training data\nWe will not be able to release the pre-processed datasets used in the paper.\nFor Wikipedia, the recommended pre-processing is to download\nthe latest dump,\nextract the text with\nWikiExtractor.py, and then apply\nany necessary cleanup to convert it into plain text.\nUnfortunately the researchers who collected the\nBookCorpus no longer have it available for\npublic download. The\nProject Guttenberg Dataset\nis a somewhat smaller (200M word) collection of older books that are public\ndomain.\nCommon Crawl is another very large collection of\ntext, but you will likely have to do substantial pre-processing and cleanup to\nextract a usable corpus for pre-training BERT.\nLearning a new WordPiece vocabulary\nThis repository does not include code for learning a new WordPiece vocabulary.\nThe reason is that the code used in the paper was implemented in C++ with\ndependencies on Google's internal libraries. For English, it is almost always\nbetter to just start with our vocabulary and pre-trained models. For learning\nvocabularies of other languages, there are a number of open source options\navailable. However, keep in mind that these are not compatible with our\ntokenization.py library:\n\n\nGoogle's SentencePiece library\n\n\ntensor2tensor's WordPiece generation script\n\n\nRico Sennrich's Byte Pair Encoding library\n\n\nUsing BERT in Colab\nIf you want to use BERT with Colab, you can\nget started with the notebook\n\"BERT FineTuning with Cloud TPUs\".\nAt the time of this writing (October 31st, 2018), Colab users can access a\nCloud TPU completely for free. Note: One per user, availability limited,\nrequires a Google Cloud Platform account with storage (although storage may be\npurchased with free credit for signing up with GCP), and this capability may not\nlonger be available in the future. Click on the BERT Colab that was just linked\nfor more information.\nFAQ\nIs this code compatible with Cloud TPUs? What about GPUs?\nYes, all of the code in this repository works out-of-the-box with CPU, GPU, and\nCloud TPU. However, GPU training is single-GPU only.\nI am getting out-of-memory errors, what is wrong?\nSee the section on out-of-memory issues for more\ninformation.\nIs there a PyTorch version available?\nThere is no official PyTorch implementation. However, NLP researchers from\nHuggingFace made a\nPyTorch version of BERT available\nwhich is compatible with our pre-trained checkpoints and is able to reproduce\nour results. We were not involved in the creation or maintenance of the PyTorch\nimplementation so please direct any questions towards the authors of that\nrepository.\nIs there a Chainer version available?\nThere is no official Chainer implementation. However, Sosuke Kobayashi made a\nChainer version of BERT available\nwhich is compatible with our pre-trained checkpoints and is able to reproduce\nour results. We were not involved in the creation or maintenance of the Chainer\nimplementation so please direct any questions towards the authors of that\nrepository.\nWill models in other languages be released?\nYes, we plan to release a multi-lingual BERT model in the near future. We cannot\nmake promises about exactly which languages will be included, but it will likely\nbe a single model which includes most of the languages which have a\nsignificantly-sized Wikipedia.\nWill models larger than BERT-Large be released?\nSo far we have not attempted to train anything larger than BERT-Large. It is\npossible that we will release larger models if we are able to obtain significant\nimprovements.\nWhat license is this library released under?\nAll code and models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

You can add the desired location to the URL in your\nrequest like this:\n$ curl wttr.in\/London\n$ curl wttr.in\/Moscow\n$ curl wttr.in\/Salt+Lake+City\n\nIf you omit the location name, you will get the report for your current location based on your IP address.\nUse 3-letter airport codes in order to get the weather information at a certain airport:\n$ curl wttr.in\/muc      # Weather for IATA: muc, Munich International Airport, Germany\n$ curl wttr.in\/ham      # Weather for IATA: ham, Hamburg Airport, Germany\n\nLet's say you'd like to get the weather for a geographical location other than a town or city - maybe an attraction\nin a city, a mountain name, or some special location. Add the character ~ before the name to look up that special\nlocation name before the weather is then retrieved:\n$ curl wttr.in\/~Vostok+Station\n$ curl wttr.in\/~Eiffel+Tower\n$ curl wttr.in\/~Kilimanjaro\n\nFor these examples, you'll see a line below the weather forecast output that shows the geolocation\nresults of looking up the location:\nLocation: Vostok Station, \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a, AAT, Antarctica [-78.4642714,106.8364678]\nLocation: Tour Eiffel, 5, Avenue Anatole France, Gros-Caillou, 7e, Paris, \u00cele-de-France, 75007, France [48.8582602,2.29449905432]\nLocation: Kilimanjaro, Northern, Tanzania [-3.4762789,37.3872648]\n\nYou can also use IP-addresses (direct) or domain names (prefixed with @) to specify a location:\n$ curl wttr.in\/@github.com\n$ curl wttr.in\/@msu.ru\n\nTo get detailed information online, you can access the \/:help page:\n$ curl wttr.in\/:help\n\nWeather Units\nBy default the USCS units are used for the queries from the USA and the metric system for the rest of the world.\nYou can override this behavior by adding ?u or ?m to a URL like this:\n$ curl wttr.in\/Amsterdam?u\n$ curl wttr.in\/Amsterdam?m\n\nSupported output formats and views\nwttr.in currently supports five output formats:\n\nANSI for the terminal;\nPlain-text for the terminal and scripts;\nHTML for the browser;\nPNG for the graphical viewers;\nJSON for scripts and APIs;\nPrometheus metrics for scripts and APIs.\n\nThe ANSI and HTML formats are selected basing on the User-Agent string.\nThe PNG format can be forced by adding .png to the end of the query:\n$ wget wttr.in\/Paris.png\n\nYou can use all of the options with the PNG-format like in an URL, but you have\nto separate them with _ instead of ? and &:\n$ wget wttr.in\/Paris_0tqp_lang=fr.png\n\nUseful options for the PNG format:\n\nt for transparency (transparency=150);\ntransparency=0..255 for a custom transparency level.\n\nTransparency is a useful feature when weather PNGs are used to add weather data to pictures:\n$ convert source.jpg <( curl wttr.in\/Oymyakon_tqp0.png ) -geometry +50+50 -composite target.jpg\n\nIn this example:\n\nsource.jpg - source file;\ntarget.jpg - target file;\nOymyakon - name of the location;\ntqp0 - options (recommended).\n\n\nYou can embed a special wttr.in widget, that displays the weather condition for the current or a selected location, into a HTML page using the wttr-switcher. That is how it looks like: wttr-switcher-example or on a real world web site: https:\/\/feuerwehr-eisolzried.de\/.\n\nOne-line output\nFor one-line output format, specify additional URL parameter format:\n$ curl wttr.in\/Nuremberg?format=3\nNuremberg: \ud83c\udf26 +11\u2070C\n\nAvailable preconfigured formats: 1, 2, 3, 4 and the custom format using the percent notation (see below).\nYou can specify multiple locations separated with : (for repeating queries):\n$ curl wttr.in\/Nuremberg:Hamburg:Berlin?format=3\nNuremberg: \ud83c\udf26 +11\u2070C\n\nOr to process all this queries at once:\n$ curl -s 'wttr.in\/{Nuremberg,Hamburg,Berlin}?format=3'\nNuremberg: \ud83c\udf26 +11\u2070C\nHamburg: \ud83c\udf26 +8\u2070C\nBerlin: \ud83c\udf26 +8\u2070C\n\nTo specify your own custom output format, use the special %-notation:\n    c    Weather condition,\n    C    Weather condition textual name,\n    h    Humidity,\n    t    Temperature (Actual),\n    f    Temperature (Feels Like),\n    w    Wind,\n    l    Location,\n    m    Moonphase \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf12\ud83c\udf13\ud83c\udf14\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf16\ud83c\udf17\ud83c\udf18,\n    M    Moonday,\n    p    precipitation (mm),\n    P    pressure (hPa),\n\n    D    Dawn*,\n    S    Sunrise*,\n    z    Zenith*,\n    s    Sunset*,\n    d    Dusk*.\n\n(*times are shown in the local timezone)\n\nSo, these two calls are the same:\n    $ curl wttr.in\/London?format=3\n    London: \u26c5\ufe0f +7\u2070C\n    $ curl wttr.in\/London?format=\"%l:+%c+%t\\n\"\n    London: \u26c5\ufe0f +7\u2070C\n\nKeep in mind, that when using in tmux.conf, you have to escape % with %, i.e. write there %% instead of %.\nIn programs, that are querying the service automatically (such as tmux), it is better to use some reasonable update interval. In tmux, you can configure it with status-interval.\nIf several, : separated locations, are specified in the query, specify update period\nas an additional query parameter period=:\nset -g status-interval 60\nWEATHER='#(curl -s wttr.in\/London:Stockholm:Moscow\\?format\\=\"%%l:+%%c%%20%%t%%60%%w&period=60\")'\nset -g status-right \"$WEATHER ...\"\n\n\nTo see emojis in terminal, you need:\n\nTerminal support for emojis (was added to Cairo 1.15.8);\nFont with emojis support.\n\nFor the Emoji font, we recommend Noto Color Emoji, and a good alternative option would be the Emoji One font;\nboth of them support all necessary emoji glyphs.\nFont configuration:\n$ cat ~\/.config\/fontconfig\/fonts.conf\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n  <alias>\n    <family>serif<\/family>\n    <prefer>\n      <family>Noto Color Emoji<\/family>\n    <\/prefer>\n  <\/alias>\n  <alias>\n    <family>sans-serif<\/family>\n    <prefer>\n      <family>Noto Color Emoji<\/family>\n    <\/prefer>\n  <\/alias>\n  <alias>\n    <family>monospace<\/family>\n    <prefer>\n      <family>Noto Color Emoji<\/family>\n    <\/prefer>\n  <\/alias>\n<\/fontconfig>\n(to apply the configuration, run fc-cache -f -v)\nData-rich output format (v2)\nIn the experimental data-rich output format, that is available under the view code v2,\na lot of additional weather and astronomical information is available:\n\nTemperature, and precepetation changes forecast throughout the days;\nMoonphase for today and the next three days;\nThe current weather condition, temperature, humidity, windspeed and direction, pressure;\nTimezone;\nDawn, sunrise, noon, sunset, dusk time for he selected location;\nPrecise geographical coordinates for the selected location.\n\n  $ curl v2.wttr.in\/M\u00fcnchen\n\nor\n  $ curl wttr.in\/M\u00fcnchen?format=v2\n\nor, if you prefer Nerd Fonts instead of Emoji, v2d (day) or v2n (night):\n  $ curl v2d.wttr.in\/M\u00fcnchen\n\n\n(The mode is experimental, and it has several limitations currently:\n\nIt works only in terminal;\nOnly English is supported).\n\nCurrently, you need some tweaks for some terminals, to get the best possible visualization.\nURXVT\nDepending on your configuration you might be taking all steps, or only a few. URXVT currently doesn't support emoji related fonts, but we can get almost the same effect using Font-Symbola. So add to your .Xresources file the following line:\n    xft:symbola:size=10:minspace=False\n\nYou can add it after your preferred font and it will only show up when required.\nThen, if you see or feel like you're having spacing issues, add this: URxvt.letterSpace: 0\nFor some reason URXVT sometimes stops deciding right the word spacing and we need to force it this way.\nThe result, should look like:\n\nMap view (v3)\nIn the experimental map view, that is available under the view code v3,\nweather information about a geographical region is available:\n    $ curl v3.wttr.in\/Bayern.sxl\n\n\nor directly in browser:\n\nhttps:\/\/v3.wttr.in\/Bayern\n\nThe map view currently supports three formats:\n\nPNG (for browser and messangers);\nSixel (terminal inline images support);\nIIP (terminal with iterm2 inline images protocol support).\n\nTerminal with inline images protocols support:\n\u27f6 Detailed article: Images in terminal\n\n\n\nTerminal\nEnvironment\nImages support\nProtocol\n\n\n\n\nuxterm\nX11\nyes\nSixel\n\n\nmlterm\nX11\nyes\nSixel\n\n\nkitty\nX11\nyes\nKitty\n\n\nwezterm\nX11\nyes\nIIP\n\n\naminal\nX11\nyes\nSixel\n\n\nJexer\nX11\nyes\nSixel\n\n\nGNOME Terminal\nX11\nin-progress\nSixel\n\n\nalacritty\nX11\nin-progress\nSixel\n\n\nfoot\nWayland\nyes\nSixel\n\n\nDomTerm\nWeb\nyes\nSixel\n\n\nYaft\nFB\nyes\nSixel\n\n\niTerm2\nMac OS X\nyes\nIIP\n\n\nmintty\nWindows\nyes\nSixel\n\n\nWindows Terminal\nWindows\nin-progress\nSixel\n\n\nRLogin\nWindows\nyes\nSixel\n\n\n\nDifferent output formats\nJSON output\nThe JSON format is a feature providing access to wttr.in data through an easy-to-parse format, without requiring the user to create a complex script to reinterpret wttr.in's graphical output.\nTo fetch information in JSON format, use the following syntax:\n$ curl wttr.in\/Detroit?format=j1\n\nThis will fetch information on the Detroit region in JSON format. The j1 format code is used to allow for the use of other layouts for the JSON output.\nThe result will look something like the following:\n{\n\t\"current_condition\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t    \"FeelsLikeC\": \"25\",\n\t\t    \"FeelsLikeF\": \"76\",\n\t\t    \"cloudcover\": \"100\",\n\t\t    \"humidity\": \"76\",\n\t\t    \"observation_time\": \"04:08 PM\",\n\t\t    \"precipMM\": \"0.2\",\n\t\t    \"pressure\": \"1019\",\n\t\t    \"temp_C\": \"22\",\n\t\t    \"temp_F\": \"72\",\n\t\t    \"uvIndex\": 5,\n\t\t    \"visibility\": \"16\",\n\t\t    \"weatherCode\": \"122\",\n\t\t    \"weatherDesc\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t    \"value\": \"Overcast\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t    ],\n\t\t    \"weatherIconUrl\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t    \"value\": \"\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t    ],\n\t\t    \"winddir16Point\": \"NNE\",\n\t\t    \"winddirDegree\": \"20\",\n\t\t    \"windspeedKmph\": \"7\",\n\t\t    \"windspeedMiles\": \"4\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n...\nMost of these values are self-explanatory, aside from weatherCode. The weatherCode is an enumeration which you can find at either the WorldWeatherOnline website or in the wttr.in source code.\nPrometheus Metrics Output\nThe Prometheus Metrics format is a feature providing access to wttr.in data through an easy-to-parse format for monitoring systems, without requiring the user to create a complex script to reinterpret wttr.in's graphical output.\nTo fetch information in Prometheus format, use the following syntax:\n$ curl wttr.in\/Detroit?format=p1\n\nThis will fetch information on the Detroit region in Prometheus Metrics format. The p1 format code is used to allow for the use of other layouts for the Prometheus Metrics output.\nA possible configuration for Prometheus could look like this:\n    - job_name: 'wttr_in_detroit'\n        static_configs:\n            - targets: ['wttr.in']\n        metrics_path: '\/Detroit'\n        params:\n            format: ['p1']\nThe result will look something like the following:\n# HELP temperature_feels_like_celsius Feels Like Temperature in Celsius\ntemperature_feels_like_celsius{forecast=\"current\"} 7\n# HELP temperature_feels_like_fahrenheit Feels Like Temperature in Fahrenheit\ntemperature_feels_like_fahrenheit{forecast=\"current\"} 45\n[truncated]\n\n...\nMoon phases\nwttr.in can also be used to check the phase of the Moon. This example shows how to see the current Moon phase\nin the full-output mode:\n$ curl wttr.in\/Moon\n\nGet the Moon phase for a particular date by adding @YYYY-MM-DD:\n$ curl wttr.in\/Moon@2016-12-25\n\nThe Moon phase information uses pyphoon as its backend.\nTo get the moon phase information in the online mode, use %m:\n$ curl wttr.in\/London?format=%m\n\ud83c\udf16\n\nKeep in mind that the Unicode representation of moonphases suffers 2 caveats:\n\n\nWith some fonts, the representation \ud83c\udf18 is ambiguous, for it either seem\nalmost-shadowed or almost-lit, depending on whether your terminal is in\nlight mode or dark mode. Relying on colored fonts like noto-fonts works\naround this problem.\n\n\nThe representation \ud83c\udf18 is also ambiguous, for it means \"last quarter\" in\nnorthern hemisphere, but \"first quarter\" in souther hemisphere. It also means\nnothing in tropical zones. This is a limitation that\nUnicode is aware about.\nBut it has not been worked around at wttr.in yet.\n\n\nSee #247, #364 for the corresponding tracking issues,\nand pyphoon#1 for pyphoon. Any help is welcome.\nInternationalization and localization\nwttr.in supports multilingual locations names that can be specified in any language in the world\n(it may be surprising, but many locations in the world don't have an English name).\nThe query string should be specified in Unicode (hex-encoded or not). Spaces in the query string\nmust be replaced with +:\n$ curl wttr.in\/\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f+\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\nWeather report: \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\n\n               Overcast\n      .--.     -65 \u2013 -47 \u00b0C\n   .-(    ).   \u2191 23 km\/h\n  (___.__)__)  15 km\n               0.0 mm\n\nThe language used for the output (except the location name) does not depend on the input language\nand it is either English (by default) or the preferred language of the browser (if the query\nwas issued from a browser) that is specified in the query headers (Accept-Language).\nThe language can be set explicitly when using console clients by using command-line options like this:\ncurl -H \"Accept-Language: fr\" wttr.in\nhttp GET wttr.in Accept-Language:ru\n\nThe preferred language can be forced using the lang option:\n$ curl wttr.in\/Berlin?lang=de\n\nThe third option is to choose the language using the DNS name used in the query:\n$ curl de.wttr.in\/Berlin\n\nwttr.in is currently translated into 54 languages, and the number of supported languages is constantly growing.\nSee \/:translation to learn more about the translation process,\nto see the list of supported languages and contributors, or to know how you can help to translate wttr.in\nin your language.\n\nWindows Users\nThere are currently two Windows related issues that prevent the examples found on this page from working exactly as expected out of the box. Until Microsoft fixes the issues, there are a few workarounds. To circumvent both issues you may use a shell such as bash on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or read on for alternative solutions.\nGarbage characters in the output\nThere is a limitation of the current Win32 version of curl. Until the Win32 curl issue is resolved and rolled out in a future Windows release, it is recommended that you use Powershell\u2019s Invoke-Web-Request command instead:\n\n(Invoke-WebRequest http:\/\/wttr.in).Content\n\nMissing or double wide diagonal wind direction characters\nThe second issue is regarding the width of the diagonal arrow glyphs that some Windows Terminal Applications such as the default conhost.exe use. At the time of writing this, ConEmu.exe, ConEmu64.exe and Terminal Applications built on top of ConEmu such as Cmder (cmder.exe) use these double-wide glyphs by default. The result is the same with all of these programs, either a missing character for certain wind directions or a broken table in the output or both. Some third-party Terminal Applications have addressed the wind direction glyph issue but that fix depends on the font and the Terminal Application you are using.\nOne way to display the diagonal wind direction glyphs in your Terminal Application is to use Windows Terminal which is currently available in the Microsoft Store. Windows Terminal is currently a preview release and will be rolled out as the default Terminal Application in an upcoming release. If your output is still skewed after using Windows Terminal then try maximizing the terminal window.\nAnother way you can display the diagonal wind direction is to swap out the problematic characters with forward and backward slashes as shown here.\nInstallation\nTo install the application:\n\nInstall external dependencies\nInstall Python dependencies used by the service\nConfigure IP2Location (optional)\nGet a WorldWeatherOnline API and configure wego\nConfigure wttr.in\nConfigure the HTTP-frontend service\n\nInstall external dependencies\nwttr.in has the following external dependencies:\n\ngolang, wego dependency\nwego, weather client for terminal\n\nAfter you install golang, install wego:\n$ go get -u github.com\/schachmat\/wego\n$ go install github.com\/schachmat\/wego\n\nInstall Python dependencies\nPython requirements:\n\nFlask\ngeoip2\ngeopy\nrequests\ngevent\n\nIf you want to get weather reports as PNG files, you'll also need to install:\n\nPIL\npyte (>=0.6)\nnecessary fonts\n\nYou can install most of them using pip.\nSome python package use LLVM, so install it first:\n$ apt-get install llvm-7 llvm-7-dev\n\nIf virtualenv is used:\n$ virtualenv -p python3 ve\n$ ve\/bin\/pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n$ ve\/bin\/python3 bin\/srv.py\n\nAlso, you need to install the geoip2 database.\nYou can use a free database GeoLite2 that can be downloaded from (http:\/\/dev.maxmind.com\/geoip\/geoip2\/geolite2\/).\nConfigure IP2Location (optional)\nIf you want to use the IP2location service for IP-addresses that are not covered by GeoLite2,\nyou have to obtain a API key of that service, and after that save into the ~\/.ip2location.key file:\n$ echo 'YOUR_IP2LOCATION_KEY' > ~\/.ip2location.key\n\nIf you don't have this file, the service will be silently skipped (it is not a big problem,\nbecause the MaxMind database is pretty good).\nInstallation with Docker\n\nInstall Docker\nBuild Docker Image\nThese files should be mounted by the user at runtime:\n\n\/root\/.wegorc\n\/root\/.ip2location.key (optional)\n\/app\/airports.dat\n\/app\/GeoLite2-City.mmdb\n\nGet a WorldWeatherOnline key and configure wego\nTo get a WorldWeatherOnline API key, you must register here:\nhttps:\/\/developer.worldweatheronline.com\/auth\/register\n\nAfter you have a WorldWeatherOnline key, you can save it into the\nWWO key file: ~\/.wwo.key\nAlso, you have to specify the key in the wego configuration:\n$ cat ~\/.wegorc\n{\n\t\"APIKey\": \"00XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n\t\"City\": \"London\",\n\t\"Numdays\": 3,\n\t\"Imperial\": false,\n\t\"Lang\": \"en\"\n}\nThe City parameter in ~\/.wegorc is ignored.\nConfigure wttr.in\nConfigure the following environment variables that define the path to the local wttr.in\ninstallation, to the GeoLite database, and to the wego installation.

Here are a few things\nthat I don't like.\nDependency resolution\nThe dependency resolution is erratic and will fail even if there is a solution. Let's take an example:\npipenv install oslo.utils==1.4.0\nwill fail with this error:\nCould not find a version that matches pbr!=0.7,!=2.1.0,<1.0,>=0.6,>=2.0.0\n\nwhile Poetry will get you the right set of packages:\npoetry add oslo.utils=1.4.0\nresults in :\n  - Installing pytz (2018.3)\n  - Installing netifaces (0.10.6)\n  - Installing netaddr (0.7.19)\n  - Installing oslo.i18n (2.1.0)\n  - Installing iso8601 (0.1.12)\n  - Installing six (1.11.0)\n  - Installing babel (2.5.3)\n  - Installing pbr (0.11.1)\n  - Installing oslo.utils (1.4.0)\n\nThis is possible thanks to the efficient dependency resolver at the heart of Poetry.\nHere is a breakdown of what exactly happens here:\noslo.utils (1.4.0) depends on:\n\npbr (>=0.6,!=0.7,<1.0)\nBabel (>=1.3)\nsix (>=1.9.0)\niso8601 (>=0.1.9)\noslo.i18n (>=1.3.0)\nnetaddr (>=0.7.12)\nnetifaces (>=0.10.4)\n\nWhat interests us is pbr (>=0.6,!=0.7,<1.0).\nAt this point, poetry will choose pbr==0.11.1 which is the latest version that matches the constraint.\nNext it will try to select oslo.i18n==3.20.0 which is the latest version that matches oslo.i18n (>=1.3.0).\nHowever this version requires pbr (!=2.1.0,>=2.0.0) which is incompatible with pbr==0.11.1,\nso poetry will try to find a version of oslo.i18n that satisfies pbr (>=0.6,!=0.7,<1.0).\nBy analyzing the releases of oslo.i18n, it will find oslo.i18n==2.1.0 which requires pbr (>=0.11,<2.0).\nAt this point the rest of the resolution is straightforward since there is no more conflict.\nResources\n\nOfficial Website\nIssue Tracker\nDiscord\n\n","163":"Zulip overview\nZulip is a powerful, open source group chat application that combines the\nimmediacy of real-time chat with the productivity benefits of threaded\nconversations.

When finished with a single image, click save.\n\nA txt file of YOLO format will be saved in the same folder as your image with same name. A file named \"classes.txt\" is saved to that folder too. \"classes.txt\" defines the list of class names that your YOLO label refers to.\nNote:\n\nYour label list shall not change in the middle of processing a list of images. When you save an image, classes.txt will also get updated, while previous annotations will not be updated.\nYou shouldn't use \"default class\" function when saving to YOLO format, it will not be referred.\nWhen saving as YOLO format, \"difficult\" flag is discarded.\n\n\nCreate pre-defined classes\nYou can edit the\ndata\/predefined_classes.txt\nto load pre-defined classes\n\nHotkeys\n\n\nCtrl + u\nLoad all of the images from a directory\n\nCtrl + r\nChange the default annotation target dir\n\nCtrl + s\nSave\n\nCtrl + d\nCopy the current label and rect box\n\nCtrl + Shift + d\nDelete the current image\n\nSpace\nFlag the current image as verified\n\nw\nCreate a rect box\n\nd\nNext image\n\na\nPrevious image\n\ndel\nDelete the selected rect box\n\nCtrl++\nZoom in\n\nCtrl--\nZoom out\n\n\u2191\u2192\u2193\u2190             |  Keyboard arrows to move selected rect box\n\n\n\nVerify Image:\nWhen pressing space, the user can flag the image as verified, a green background will appear.\nThis is used when creating a dataset automatically, the user can then through all the pictures and flag them instead of annotate them.\nDifficult:\nThe difficult field is set to 1 indicates that the object has been annotated as \"difficult\", for example, an object which is clearly visible but difficult to recognize without substantial use of context.\nAccording to your deep neural network implementation, you can include or exclude difficult objects during training.\n\nHow to reset the settings\nIn case there are issues with loading the classes, you can either:\n\nFrom the top menu of the labelimg click on Menu\/File\/Reset All\n\nRemove the .labelImgSettings.pkl from your home directory.

- a faster way to navigate your filesystem\nDESCRIPTION\nautojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by\nmaintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the\ncommand line.\nDirectories must be visited first before they can be jumped to.\nUSAGE\nj is a convenience wrapper function around autojump. Any option that\ncan be used with autojump can be used with j and vice versa.\n\n\nJump To A Directory That Contains foo:\nj foo\n\n\n\nJump To A Child Directory:\nSometimes it's convenient to jump to a child directory\n(sub-directory of current directory) rather than typing out the\nfull name.\njc bar\n\n\n\nOpen File Manager To Directories (instead of jumping):\nInstead of jumping to a directory, you can open a file explorer\nwindow (Mac Finder, Windows Explorer, GNOME Nautilus, etc.) to the\ndirectory instead.\njo music\n\nOpening a file manager to a child directory is also supported:\njco images\n\n\n\nUsing Multiple Arguments:\nLet's assume the following database:\n30   \/home\/user\/mail\/inbox\n10   \/home\/user\/work\/inbox\n\nj in would jump into \/home\/user\/mail\/inbox as the higher\nweighted entry. However you can pass multiple arguments to autojump\nto prefer a different entry. In the above example, j w in would\nthen change directory to \/home\/user\/work\/inbox.\n\n\nFor more options refer to help:\nautojump --help\n\nINSTALLATION\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nPython v2.6+ or Python v3.3+\nSupported shells\n\nbash - first class support\nzsh - first class support\nfish - community supported\ntcsh - community supported\nclink - community supported\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\nLinux - first class support\nOS X - first class support\nWindows - community supported\nBSD - community supported\n\n\nSupported installation methods\n\nsource code - first class support\nDebian and derivatives - first class support\nArchLinux \/ Gentoo \/ openSUSE \/ RedHat and derivatives -\ncommunity supported\nHomebrew \/ MacPorts - community supported\n\n\n\nDue to limited time and resources, only \"first class support\" items will\nbe maintained by the primary committers.

forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.\nProphet is open source software released by Facebook's Core Data Science team. It is available for download on CRAN and PyPI.\nImportant links\n\nHomepage: https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/\nHTML documentation: https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/quick_start.html\nIssue tracker: https:\/\/github.com\/facebook\/prophet\/issues\nSource code repository: https:\/\/github.com\/facebook\/prophet\nProphet R package: https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/package=prophet\nProphet Python package: https:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/fbprophet\/\nRelease blogpost: https:\/\/research.fb.com\/prophet-forecasting-at-scale\/\nProphet paper: Sean J. Taylor, Benjamin Letham (2018) Forecasting at scale. The American Statistician 72(1):37-45 (https:\/\/peerj.com\/preprints\/3190.pdf).\n\nInstallation in R\nProphet is a CRAN package so you can use install.packages.\ninstall.packages('prophet')\nAfter installation, you can get started!\nWindows\nOn Windows, R requires a compiler so you'll need to follow the instructions provided by rstan. The key step is installing Rtools before attempting to install the package.\nIf you have custom Stan compiler settings, install from source rather than the CRAN binary.\nInstallation in Python\nProphet is on PyPI, so you can use pip to install it. From v0.6 onwards, Python 2 is no longer supported.\n# Install pystan with pip before using pip to install fbprophet\npip install pystan\n\npip install fbprophet\nThe default dependency that Prophet has is pystan. PyStan has its own installation instructions. Install pystan with pip before using pip to install fbprophet.\nYou can also choose a (more experimental) alternative stan backend called cmdstanpy. It requires the CmdStan command line interface and you will have to specify the environment variable STAN_BACKEND pointing to it, for example:\n# bash\n$ CMDSTAN=\/tmp\/cmdstan-2.22.1 STAN_BACKEND=CMDSTANPY pip install fbprophet\n\nNote that the CMDSTAN variable is directly related to cmdstanpy module and can be omitted if your CmdStan binaries are in your $PATH.\nIt is also possible to install Prophet with two backends:\n# bash\n$ CMDSTAN=\/tmp\/cmdstan-2.22.1 STAN_BACKEND=PYSTAN,CMDSTANPY pip install fbprophet\n\nAfter installation, you can get started!\nIf you upgrade the version of PyStan installed on your system, you may need to reinstall fbprophet (see here).\nAnaconda\nUse conda install gcc to set up gcc. The easiest way to install Prophet is through conda-forge: conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet.\nWindows\nOn Windows, PyStan requires a compiler so you'll need to follow the instructions. The easiest way to install Prophet in Windows is in Anaconda.\nLinux\nMake sure compilers (gcc, g++, build-essential) and Python development tools (python-dev, python3-dev) are installed. In Red Hat systems, install the packages gcc64 and gcc64-c++. If you are using a VM, be aware that you will need at least 4GB of memory to install fbprophet, and at least 2GB of memory to use fbprophet.\nChangelog\nVersion 0.6 (2020.03.03)\n\nFix bugs related to upstream changes in holidays and pandas packages.\nCompile model during first use, not during install (to comply with CRAN policy)\ncmdstanpy backend now available in Python\nPython 2 no longer supported\n\nVersion 0.5 (2019.05.14)\n\nConditional seasonalities\nImproved cross validation estimates\nPlotly plot in Python\nBugfixes\n\nVersion 0.4 (2018.12.18)\n\nAdded holidays functionality\nBugfixes\n\nVersion 0.3 (2018.06.01)\n\nMultiplicative seasonality\nCross validation error metrics and visualizations\nParameter to set range of potential changepoints\nUnified Stan model for both trend types\nImproved future trend uncertainty for sub-daily data\nBugfixes\n\nVersion 0.2.1 (2017.11.08)\n\nBugfixes\n\nVersion 0.2 (2017.09.02)\n\nForecasting with sub-daily data\nDaily seasonality, and custom seasonalities\nExtra regressors\nAccess to posterior predictive samples\nCross-validation function\nSaturating minimums\nBugfixes\n\nVersion 0.1.1 (2017.04.17)\n\nBugfixes\nNew options for detecting yearly and weekly seasonality (now the default)\n\nVersion 0.1 (2017.02.23)\n\nInitial release\n\nLicense\nProphet is licensed under the MIT license.\n","176":"\nEnglish svg pdf jpg png\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 svg pdf jpg png by tkchu\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis work (the WORK) was created by Milo Yip (the AUTHOR), who has been a game developer for more than 20 years.\nThe books shown in the WORK represent knowledge\/skills that may\/should be acquired by game programmers.

Some trade-offs were made in order to make this typeface work really well at small sizes:\n\nCurrently not suitable for very large sizes because of some small-scale glyph optimizations (like \"pits\" and \"traps\") that help rasterization at small sizes but stand out and interfere at large sizes.\nRasterized at sizes below 12px, some stems\u2014like the horizontal center of \"E\", \"F\", or vertical center of \"m\"\u2014are drawn with two semi-opaque pixels instead of one solid. This is because we \"prioritize\" (optimize for) higher-density rasterizations. If we move these stems to an off-center position\u2014so that they can be drawn sharply at e.g. 11px\u2014text will be less legible at higher resolutions.\n\nCurrent font styles:\n\n\n\nName\nWeight class\n\n\n\n\nThin\n100\n\n\nThin Italic\n100\n\n\nExtra Light\n200\n\n\nExtra Light Italic\n200\n\n\nLight\n300\n\n\nLight Italic\n300\n\n\nRegular\n400\n\n\nItalic\n400\n\n\nMedium\n500\n\n\nMedium Italic\n500\n\n\nSemi Bold\n600\n\n\nSemi Bold Italic\n600\n\n\nBold\n700\n\n\nBold Italic\n700\n\n\nExtra Bold\n800\n\n\nExtra Bold Italic\n800\n\n\nBlack\n900\n\n\nBlack Italic\n900\n\n\n\nInter also ships as a variable font.\nFont metrics\nThis font was originally designed to work at a specific size: 11px. Thus, the Units per EM (UPM) is defined in such a way that a power-of-two multiple of one EM unit ends up at an integer value compared to a pixel. Most fonts are designed with a UPM of either 1000 or 2048. Because of this we picked a value that is as high as possible but also as close as possible to one of those common values (since it's reasonable to assume that some layout engines and rasterizers are optimized for those value magnitudes.) We ended up picking a UPM of 2816 which equates to exactly 256 units per pixel when rasterized for size 11pt at 1x scale. This also means that when rasterized at power-of-two scales (like 2x and 4x) the number of EM units corresponding to a pixel is an integer (128 units for 2x, 64 for 4x, and so on.)\nHowever, as the project progressed and the typeface was put into use, it quickly\nbecame clear that for anything longer than a short word, it was actually hard to\nread the almost monotonically-spaced letters.\nA second major revision was created where the previously-strict rule of geometry being even multiples of 256 was relaxed and now the rule is \"try to stick with 128x, if you can't, stick with 64x and if you can't do that either, never go below 16x.\" This means that Inter is now much more variable in pace than it used to be, making it work better at higher resolutions and work much better in longer text, but losing some contrast and sharpness at small sizes.\n\nThe glyphs are designed based on this \"plan\"; most stems and lines will be positioned at EM units that are even multiples of 128, and in a few cases they are at even multiples of 64 or as low as 16.\nMetrics:\n\nUPM:        2816\nDescender:  -640\nx-height:   1536\nCap height: 2048\nAscender:   2688\n\nTranslating between EM units and pixels:\n\nRasterized at 11px: 1px = 256 units\nRasterized at 22px: 1px = 128 units\nRasterized at 44px: 1px =  64 units\n\nThere's a Figma workspace for glyphs, with configured metrics: \"Inter glyphs\"\nSupporters\nA wholehearted Thank You to everyone who supports the Inter project!\nDonors\n\n@adrianmg\n@artemc\n@bapun26\n@brianlovin\n@chadlittle\n@colinkeany\n@danrowden\n@davo\n@emuravjev\n@gbougakov\n@jakejarvis\n@lukesbeard\n@lustfullyCake\n@mamuso\n@mbullington\n@muuvmuuv\n@NetOperatorWibby\n@pedromvpg\n@pmarsceill\n@romashamin\n@ruslangirichev\n@saishmenon\n@satyakresna\n@sorentwo\n@StandardResumeSponsors\n@stpnkcrk\n@taravancil\n@usmanity\n@zethussuen\nStefan Kempf\n\n(Private donors excluded)\nContributors\n\n@thundernixon\n@KatjaSchimmel\n@kdrag0n\n@gabrielizaias\n@fractaledmind\n@davelab6\n@Veratyr\n@Calinou\n\nDevelopment\nFor instructions on how to work with the source files and how to\ncompile & build font files,\nrefer to CONTRIBUTING.md.\nInter is licensed under the SIL Open Font License\n","178":"Faker is a Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether\nyou need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,\nfill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from\na production service, Faker is for you.\nFaker is heavily inspired by PHP Faker, Perl Faker, and by Ruby Faker.\n\n_|_|_|_|          _|\n_|        _|_|_|  _|  _|      _|_|    _|  _|_|\n_|_|_|  _|    _|  _|_|      _|_|_|_|  _|_|\n_|      _|    _|  _|  _|    _|        _|\n_|        _|_|_|  _|    _|    _|_|_|  _|\n\n    \n\n\nCompatibility\nStarting from version 4.0.0, Faker dropped support for Python 2 and only supports Python\n3.5 and above. If you still need Python 2 compatibility, please install version 3.0.1 in the\nmeantime, and please consider updating your codebase to support Python 3 so you can enjoy the\nlatest features Faker has to offer. Please see the extended docs for more details, especially\nif you are upgrading from version 2.0.4 and below as there might be breaking changes.\nThis package was also previously called fake-factory which was already deprecated by the end\nof 2016, and much has changed since then, so please ensure that your project and its dependencies\ndo not depend on the old package.\n\nBasic Usage\nInstall with pip:\npip install Faker\nUse faker.Faker() to create and initialize a faker\ngenerator, which can generate data by accessing properties named after\nthe type of data you want.\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker()\n\nfake.name()\n# 'Lucy Cechtelar'\n\nfake.address()\n# '426 Jordy Lodge\n#  Cartwrightshire, SC 88120-6700'\n\nfake.text()\n# 'Sint velit eveniet.

Please check out the pytest fixture docs to learn more.\n\nProviders\nEach of the generator properties (like name, address, and\nlorem) are called \"fake\". A faker generator has many of them,\npackaged in \"providers\".\nfrom faker import Faker\nfrom faker.providers import internet\n\nfake = Faker()\nfake.add_provider(internet)\n\nprint(fake.ipv4_private())\nCheck the extended docs for a list of bundled providers and a list of\ncommunity providers.\n\nLocalization\nfaker.Faker can take a locale as an argument, to return localized\ndata. If no localized provider is found, the factory falls back to the\ndefault en_US locale.\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker('it_IT')\nfor _ in range(10):\n    print(fake.name())\n\n# 'Elda Palumbo'\n# 'Pacifico Giordano'\n# 'Sig.

The localization of Faker is an ongoing process, for\nwhich we need your help. Please don't hesitate to create a localized\nprovider for your own locale and submit a Pull Request (PR).\n\nCommand line usage\nWhen installed, you can invoke faker from the command-line:\nfaker [-h] [--version] [-o output]\n      [-l {bg_BG,cs_CZ,...,zh_CN,zh_TW}]\n      [-r REPEAT] [-s SEP]\n      [-i {package.containing.custom_provider otherpkg.containing.custom_provider}]\n      [fake] [fake argument [fake argument ...]]\nWhere:\n\nfaker: is the script when installed in your environment, in\ndevelopment you could use python -m faker instead\n-h, --help: shows a help message\n--version: shows the program's version number\n-o FILENAME: redirects the output to the specified filename\n-l {bg_BG,cs_CZ,...,zh_CN,zh_TW}: allows use of a localized\nprovider\n-r REPEAT: will generate a specified number of outputs\n-s SEP: will generate the specified separator after each\ngenerated output\n-i {my.custom_provider other.custom_provider} list of additional custom\nproviders to use. Note that is the import path of the package containing\nyour Provider class, not the custom Provider class itself.\nfake: is the name of the fake to generate an output for, such as\nname, address, or text\n[fake argument ...]: optional arguments to pass to the fake (e.g. the\nprofile fake takes an optional list of comma separated field names as the\nfirst argument)\n\nExamples:\n$ faker address\n968 Bahringer Garden Apt. 722\nKristinaland, NJ 09890\n\n$ faker -l de_DE address\nSamira-Niemeier-Allee 56\n94812 Biedenkopf\n\n$ faker profile ssn,birthdate\n{'ssn': u'628-10-1085', 'birthdate': '2008-03-29'}\n\n$ faker -r=3 -s=\";\" name\nWillam Kertzmann;\nJosiah Maggio;\nGayla Schmitt;\n\nHow to create a Provider\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker()\n\n# first, import a similar Provider or use the default one\nfrom faker.providers import BaseProvider\n\n# create new provider class\nclass MyProvider(BaseProvider):\n    def foo(self):\n        return 'bar'\n\n# then add new provider to faker instance\nfake.add_provider(MyProvider)\n\n# now you can use:\nfake.foo()\n# 'bar'\n\nHow to customize the Lorem Provider\nYou can provide your own sets of words if you don't want to use the\ndefault lorem ipsum one. The following example shows how to do it with a list of words picked from cakeipsum :\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker()\n\nmy_word_list = [\n'danish','cheesecake','sugar',\n'Lollipop','wafer','Gummies',\n'sesame','Jelly','beans',\n'pie','bar','Ice','oat' ]\n\nfake.sentence()\n# 'Expedita at beatae voluptatibus nulla omnis.'\n\nfake.sentence(ext_word_list=my_word_list)\n# 'Oat beans oat Lollipop bar cheesecake.'\n\nHow to use with Factory Boy\nFactory Boy already ships with integration with Faker. Simply use the\nfactory.Faker method of factory_boy:\nimport factory\nfrom myapp.models import Book\n\nclass BookFactory(factory.Factory):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Book\n\n    title = factory.Faker('sentence', nb_words=4)\n    author_name = factory.Faker('name')\n\nAccessing the random instance\nThe .random property on the generator returns the instance of\nrandom.Random used to generate the values:\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker()\nfake.random\nfake.random.getstate()\nBy default all generators share the same instance of random.Random, which\ncan be accessed with from faker.generator import random. Using this may\nbe useful for plugins that want to affect all faker instances.\n\nUnique values\nThrough use of the .unique property on the generator, you can guarantee\nthat any generated values are unique for this specific instance.\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker()\nnames = [fake.unique.first_name() for i in range(500)]\nassert len(set(names)) == len(names)\nCalling fake.unique.clear() clears the already seen values.\nNote, to avoid infinite loops, after a number of attempts to find a unique\nvalue, Faker will throw a UniquenessException. Beware of the birthday\nparadox, collisions\nare more likely than you'd think.\nfrom faker import Faker\n\nfake = Faker()\nfor i in range(3):\n     # Raises a UniquenessException\n     fake.unique.boolean()\nIn addition, only hashable arguments and return values can be used\nwith .unique.\n\nSeeding the Generator\nWhen using Faker for unit testing, you will often want to generate the same\ndata set. For convenience, the generator also provide a seed() method,\nwhich seeds the shared random number generator. Calling the same methods with\nthe same version of faker and seed produces the same results.\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker()\nFaker.seed(4321)\n\nprint(fake.name())\n# 'Margaret Boehm'\nEach generator can also be switched to its own instance of random.Random,\nseparate to the shared one, by using the seed_instance() method, which acts\nthe same way. For example:\nfrom faker import Faker\nfake = Faker()\nfake.seed_instance(4321)\n\nprint(fake.name())\n# 'Margaret Boehm'\nPlease note that as we keep updating datasets, results are not guaranteed to be\nconsistent across patch versions. If you hardcode results in your test, make sure\nyou pinned the version of Faker down to the patch number.\nIf you are using pytest, you can seed the faker fixture by defining a faker_seed\nfixture. Please check out the pytest fixture docs to learn more.\n\nTests\nRun tests:\n$ tox\nWrite documentation for providers:\n$ python -m faker > docs.txt\n\nContribute\nPlease see CONTRIBUTING.\n\nLicense\nFaker is released under the MIT License.

You must have them installed prior to installing\ngensim.\nIt is also recommended you install a fast BLAS library before installing\nNumPy. This is optional, but using an optimized BLAS such as ATLAS or\nOpenBLAS is known to improve performance by as much as an order of\nmagnitude. On OS X, NumPy picks up the BLAS that comes with it\nautomatically, so you don\u2019t need to do anything special.\nInstall the latest version of gensim:\n    pip install --upgrade gensim\nOr, if you have instead downloaded and unzipped the source tar.gz\npackage:\n    python setup.py install\nFor alternative modes of installation, see the documentation.\nGensim is being continuously tested under Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.\nSupport for Python 2.7 was dropped in gensim 4.0.0 \u2013 install gensim 3.8.3 if you must use Python 2.7.\nHow come gensim is so fast and memory efficient? Isn\u2019t it pure Python, and isn\u2019t Python slow and greedy?\nMany scientific algorithms can be expressed in terms of large matrix\noperations (see the BLAS note above). Gensim taps into these low-level\nBLAS libraries, by means of its dependency on NumPy. So while\ngensim-the-top-level-code is pure Python, it actually executes highly\noptimized Fortran\/C under the hood, including multithreading (if your\nBLAS is so configured).\nMemory-wise, gensim makes heavy use of Python\u2019s built-in generators and\niterators for streamed data processing. Memory efficiency was one of\ngensim\u2019s design goals, and is a central feature of gensim, rather than\nsomething bolted on as an afterthought.\nDocumentation\n\nQuickStart\nTutorials\nOfficial API Documentation\n\nSupport\nAsk open-ended or research questions on the Gensim Mailing List.\nRaise bugs on Github but make sure you follow the issue template.

What if you could increase the resolution of your photos using technology from CSI laboratories? Thanks to deep learning and #NeuralEnhance, it's now possible to train a neural network to zoom in to your images at 2x or even 4x.  You'll get even better results by increasing the number of neurons or training with a dataset similar to your low resolution image.\nThe catch? The neural network is hallucinating details based on its training from example images. It's not reconstructing your photo exactly as it would have been if it was HD. That's only possible in Hollywood \u2014 but using deep learning as \"Creative AI\" works and it is just as cool!  Here's how you can get started...\n\nExamples & Usage\nInstallation\nBackground & Research\nTroubleshooting\nFrequent Questions\n\n\n \n \n\n\n1. Examples & Usage\nThe main script is called enhance.py, which you can run with Python 3.4+ once it's setup as below.  The --device argument that lets you specify which GPU or CPU to use. For the samples above, here are the performance results:\n\nGPU Rendering HQ \u2014 Assuming you have CUDA setup and enough on-board RAM to fit the image and neural network, generating 1080p output should complete in 5 seconds, or 2s per image if multiple at the same time.\nCPU Rendering HQ \u2014 This will take roughly 20 to 60 seconds for 1080p output, however on most machines you can run 4-8 processes simultaneously given enough system RAM. Runtime depends on the neural network size.\n\nThe default is to use --device=cpu, if you have NVIDIA card setup with CUDA already try --device=gpu0. On the CPU, you can also set environment variable to OMP_NUM_THREADS=4, which is most useful when running the script multiple times in parallel.\n\n1.a) Enhancing Images\nA list of example command lines you can use with the pre-trained models provided in the GitHub releases:\n# Run the super-resolution script to repair JPEG artefacts, zoom factor 1:1.\npython3 enhance.py --type=photo --model=repair --zoom=1 broken.jpg\n\n# Process multiple good quality images with a single run, zoom factor 2:1.\npython3 enhance.py --type=photo --zoom=2 file1.jpg file2.jpg\n\n# Display output images that were given `_ne?x.png` suffix.\nopen *_ne?x.png\nHere's a list of currently supported models, image types, and zoom levels in one table.\n\n\nFEATURES\n--model=default\n--model=repair\n--model=denoise\n--model=deblur\n\n\n\n--type=photo\n2x\n1x\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n1.b) Training Super-Resolution\nPre-trained models are provided in the GitHub releases.  Training your own is a delicate process that may require you to pick parameters based on your image dataset.\n# Remove the model file as don't want to reload the data to fine-tune it.\nrm -f ne?x*.pkl.bz2\n\n# Pre-train the model using perceptual loss from paper [1] below.\npython3.4 enhance.py --train \"data\/*.jpg\" --model custom --scales=2 --epochs=50 \\\n    --perceptual-layer=conv2_2 --smoothness-weight=1e7 --adversary-weight=0.0 \\\n    --generator-blocks=4 --generator-filters=64\n\n# Train the model using an adversarial setup based on [4] below.\npython3.4 enhance.py --train \"data\/*.jpg\" --model custom --scales=2 --epochs=250 \\\n         --perceptual-layer=conv5_2 --smoothness-weight=2e4 --adversary-weight=1e3 \\\n         --generator-start=5 --discriminator-start=0 --adversarial-start=5 \\\n         --discriminator-size=64\n\n# The newly trained model is output into this file...\nls ne?x-custom-*.pkl.bz2\n\nExample #2 \u2014 Bank Lobby: view comparison in 24-bit HD, original photo CC-BY-SA @benarent.\n\n2. Installation & Setup\n\n2.a) Using Docker Image [recommended]\nThe easiest way to get up-and-running is to install Docker. Then, you should be able to download and run the pre-built image using the docker command line tool.  Find out more about the alexjc\/neural-enhance image on its Docker Hub page.\nHere's the simplest way you can call the script using docker, assuming you're familiar with using -v argument to mount folders you can use this directly to specify files to enhance:\n# Download the Docker image and show the help text to make sure it works.\ndocker run --rm -v `pwd`:\/ne\/input -it alexjc\/neural-enhance --help\nSingle Image \u2014 In practice, we suggest you setup an alias called enhance to automatically expose the folder containing your specified image, so the script can read it and store results where you can access them.  This is how you can do it in your terminal console on OSX or Linux:\n# Setup the alias. Put this in your .bashrc or .zshrc file so it's available at startup.\nalias enhance='function ne() { docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd)\/`dirname ${@:$#}`\":\/ne\/input -it alexjc\/neural-enhance ${@:1:$#-1} \"input\/`basename ${@:$#}`\"; }; ne'\n\n# Now run any of the examples above using this alias, without the `.py` extension.\nenhance --zoom=1 --model=repair images\/broken.jpg\nMultiple Images \u2014 To enhance multiple images in a row (faster) from a folder or wildcard specification, make sure to quote the argument to the alias command:\n# Process multiple images, make sure to quote the argument!\nenhance --zoom=2 \"images\/*.jpg\"\nIf you want to run on your NVIDIA GPU, you can instead change the alias to use the image alexjc\/neural-enhance:gpu which comes with CUDA and CUDNN pre-installed.  Then run it within nvidia-docker and it should use your physical hardware!\n\n2.b) Manual Installation [developers]\nThis project requires Python 3.4+ and you'll also need numpy and scipy (numerical computing libraries) as well as python3-dev installed system-wide.  If you want more detailed instructions, follow these:\n\nLinux Installation of Lasagne (intermediate)\nMac OSX Installation of Lasagne (advanced)\nWindows Installation of Lasagne (expert)\n\nAfterward fetching the repository, you can run the following commands from your terminal to setup a local environment:\n# Create a local environment for Python 3.x to install dependencies here.\npython3 -m venv pyvenv --system-site-packages\n\n# If you're using bash, make this the active version of Python.\nsource pyvenv\/bin\/activate\n\n# Setup the required dependencies simply using the PIP module.\npython3 -m pip install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt\nAfter this, you should have pillow, theano and lasagne installed in your virtual environment.  You'll also need to download this pre-trained neural network (VGG19, 80Mb) and put it in the same folder as the script to run. To de-install everything, you can just delete the #\/pyvenv\/ folder.\n\nExample #3 \u2014 Specialized super-resolution for faces, trained on HD examples of celebrity faces only.  The quality is significantly higher when narrowing the domain from \"photos\" in general.\n\n3. Background & Research\nThis code uses a combination of techniques from the following papers, as well as some minor improvements yet to be documented (watch this repository for updates):\n\nPerceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution\nReal-Time Super-Resolution Using Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolution\nDeeply-Recursive Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolution\nPhoto-Realistic Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network\n\nSpecial thanks for their help and support in various ways:\n\nEder Santana \u2014 Discussions, encouragement, and his ideas on sub-pixel deconvolution.\nAndrew Brock \u2014 This sub-pixel layer code is based on his project repository using Lasagne.\nCasper Kaae S\u00f8nderby \u2014 For suggesting a more stable alternative to sigmoid + log as GAN loss functions.\n\n\n4. Troubleshooting Problems\n\nCan't install or Unable to find pgen, not compiling formal grammar.\nThere's a Python extension compiler called Cython, and it's missing or improperly installed. Try getting it directly from the system package manager rather than PIP.\nFIX: sudo apt-get install cython3\n\nNotImplementedError: AbstractConv2d theano optimization failed.\nThis happens when you're running without a GPU, and the CPU libraries were not found (e.g. libblas).  The neural network expressions cannot be evaluated by Theano and it's raising an exception.\nFIX: sudo apt-get install libblas-dev libopenblas-dev\n\nTypeError: max_pool_2d() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mode'\nYou need to install Lasagne and Theano directly from the versions specified in requirements.txt, rather than from the PIP versions.  These alternatives are older and don't have the required features.\nFIX: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8\nIt seems your terminal is misconfigured and not compatible with the way Python treats locales. You may need to change this in your .bashrc or other startup script. Alternatively, this command will fix it once for this shell instance.\nFIX: export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nExample #4 \u2014 Street View: view comparison in 24-bit HD, original photo CC-BY-SA @cyalex.\n\n\n \n \n","181":"Tensor2Tensor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTensor2Tensor, or\nT2T for short, is a library\nof deep learning models and datasets designed to make deep learning more\naccessible and accelerate ML\nresearch.\nT2T was developed by researchers and engineers in the\nGoogle Brain team and a community\nof users.

We usually\nrun either on Cloud TPUs or on 8-GPU machines; you might need\nto modify the hyperparameters if you run on a different setup.\nMathematical Language Understanding\nFor evaluating mathematical expressions at the character level involving addition, subtraction and multiplication of both positive and negative decimal numbers with variable digits assigned to symbolic variables, use\n\nthe MLU data-set:\n--problem=algorithmic_math_two_variables\n\nYou can try solving the problem with different transformer models and hyperparameters as described in the paper:\n\nStandard transformer:\n--model=transformer\n--hparams_set=transformer_tiny\nUniversal transformer:\n--model=universal_transformer\n--hparams_set=universal_transformer_tiny\nAdaptive universal transformer:\n--model=universal_transformer\n--hparams_set=adaptive_universal_transformer_tiny\n\nStory, Question and Answer\nFor answering questions based on a story, use\n\nthe bAbi data-set:\n--problem=babi_qa_concat_task1_1k\n\nYou can choose the bAbi task from the range [1,20] and the subset from 1k or\n10k. To combine test data from all tasks into a single test set, use\n--problem=babi_qa_concat_all_tasks_10k\nImage Classification\nFor image classification, we have a number of standard data-sets:\n\nImageNet (a large data-set): --problem=image_imagenet, or one\nof the re-scaled versions (image_imagenet224, image_imagenet64,\nimage_imagenet32)\nCIFAR-10: --problem=image_cifar10 (or\n--problem=image_cifar10_plain to turn off data augmentation)\nCIFAR-100: --problem=image_cifar100\nMNIST: --problem=image_mnist\n\nFor ImageNet, we suggest to use the ResNet or Xception, i.e.,\nuse --model=resnet --hparams_set=resnet_50 or\n--model=xception --hparams_set=xception_base.\nResnet should get to above 76% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\nFor CIFAR and MNIST, we suggest to try the shake-shake model:\n--model=shake_shake --hparams_set=shakeshake_big.\nThis setting trained for --train_steps=700000 should yield\nclose to 97% accuracy on CIFAR-10.\nImage Generation\nFor (un)conditional image generation, we have a number of standard data-sets:\n\nCelebA: --problem=img2img_celeba for image-to-image translation, namely,\nsuperresolution from 8x8 to 32x32.\nCelebA-HQ: --problem=image_celeba256_rev for a downsampled 256x256.\nCIFAR-10: --problem=image_cifar10_plain_gen_rev for class-conditional\n32x32 generation.\nLSUN Bedrooms: --problem=image_lsun_bedrooms_rev\nMS-COCO: --problem=image_text_ms_coco_rev for text-to-image generation.\nSmall ImageNet (a large data-set): --problem=image_imagenet32_gen_rev for\n32x32 or --problem=image_imagenet64_gen_rev for 64x64.\n\nWe suggest to use the Image Transformer, i.e., --model=imagetransformer, or\nthe Image Transformer Plus, i.e., --model=imagetransformerpp that uses\ndiscretized mixture of logistics, or variational auto-encoder, i.e.,\n--model=transformer_ae.\nFor CIFAR-10, using --hparams_set=imagetransformer_cifar10_base or\n--hparams_set=imagetransformer_cifar10_base_dmol yields 2.90 bits per\ndimension. For Imagenet-32, using\n--hparams_set=imagetransformer_imagenet32_base yields 3.77 bits per dimension.\nLanguage Modeling\nFor language modeling, we have these data-sets in T2T:\n\nPTB (a small data-set): --problem=languagemodel_ptb10k for\nword-level modeling and --problem=languagemodel_ptb_characters\nfor character-level modeling.\nLM1B (a billion-word corpus): --problem=languagemodel_lm1b32k for\nsubword-level modeling and --problem=languagemodel_lm1b_characters\nfor character-level modeling.\n\nWe suggest to start with --model=transformer on this task and use\n--hparams_set=transformer_small for PTB and\n--hparams_set=transformer_base for LM1B.\nSentiment Analysis\nFor the task of recognizing the sentiment of a sentence, use\n\nthe IMDB data-set: --problem=sentiment_imdb\n\nWe suggest to use --model=transformer_encoder here and since it is\na small data-set, try --hparams_set=transformer_tiny and train for\nfew steps (e.g., --train_steps=2000).\nSpeech Recognition\nFor speech-to-text, we have these data-sets in T2T:\n\n\nLibrispeech (US English): --problem=librispeech for\nthe whole set and --problem=librispeech_clean for a smaller\nbut nicely filtered part.\n\n\nMozilla Common Voice (US English): --problem=common_voice for the whole set\n--problem=common_voice_clean for a quality-checked subset.\n\n\nSummarization\nFor summarizing longer text into shorter one we have these data-sets:\n\nCNN\/DailyMail articles summarized into a few sentences:\n--problem=summarize_cnn_dailymail32k\n\nWe suggest to use --model=transformer and\n--hparams_set=transformer_prepend for this task.\nThis yields good ROUGE scores.\nTranslation\nThere are a number of translation data-sets in T2T:\n\nEnglish-German: --problem=translate_ende_wmt32k\nEnglish-French: --problem=translate_enfr_wmt32k\nEnglish-Czech: --problem=translate_encs_wmt32k\nEnglish-Chinese: --problem=translate_enzh_wmt32k\nEnglish-Vietnamese: --problem=translate_envi_iwslt32k\nEnglish-Spanish: --problem=translate_enes_wmt32k\n\nYou can get translations in the other direction by appending _rev to\nthe problem name, e.g., for German-English use\n--problem=translate_ende_wmt32k_rev\n(note that you still need to download the original data with t2t-datagen\n--problem=translate_ende_wmt32k).\nFor all translation problems, we suggest to try the Transformer model:\n--model=transformer. At first it is best to try the base setting,\n--hparams_set=transformer_base. When trained on 8 GPUs for 300K steps\nthis should reach a BLEU score of about 28 on the English-German data-set,\nwhich is close to state-of-the art. If training on a single GPU, try the\n--hparams_set=transformer_base_single_gpu setting. For very good results\nor larger data-sets (e.g., for English-French), try the big model\nwith --hparams_set=transformer_big.\nSee this example to know how the translation works.\nBasics\nWalkthrough\nHere's a walkthrough training a good English-to-German translation\nmodel using the Transformer model from Attention Is All You\nNeed on WMT data.\npip install tensor2tensor\n\n# See what problems, models, and hyperparameter sets are available.\n# You can easily swap between them (and add new ones).\nt2t-trainer --registry_help\n\nPROBLEM=translate_ende_wmt32k\nMODEL=transformer\nHPARAMS=transformer_base_single_gpu\n\nDATA_DIR=$HOME\/t2t_data\nTMP_DIR=\/tmp\/t2t_datagen\nTRAIN_DIR=$HOME\/t2t_train\/$PROBLEM\/$MODEL-$HPARAMS\n\nmkdir -p $DATA_DIR $TMP_DIR $TRAIN_DIR\n\n# Generate data\nt2t-datagen \\\n  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \\\n  --tmp_dir=$TMP_DIR \\\n  --problem=$PROBLEM\n\n# Train\n# *  If you run out of memory, add --hparams='batch_size=1024'.\nt2t-trainer \\\n  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \\\n  --problem=$PROBLEM \\\n  --model=$MODEL \\\n  --hparams_set=$HPARAMS \\\n  --output_dir=$TRAIN_DIR\n\n# Decode\n\nDECODE_FILE=$DATA_DIR\/decode_this.txt\necho \"Hello world\" >> $DECODE_FILE\necho \"Goodbye world\" >> $DECODE_FILE\necho -e 'Hallo Welt\\nAuf Wiedersehen Welt' > ref-translation.de\n\nBEAM_SIZE=4\nALPHA=0.6\n\nt2t-decoder \\\n  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \\\n  --problem=$PROBLEM \\\n  --model=$MODEL \\\n  --hparams_set=$HPARAMS \\\n  --output_dir=$TRAIN_DIR \\\n  --decode_hparams=\"beam_size=$BEAM_SIZE,alpha=$ALPHA\" \\\n  --decode_from_file=$DECODE_FILE \\\n  --decode_to_file=translation.en\n\n# See the translations\ncat translation.en\n\n# Evaluate the BLEU score\n# Note: Report this BLEU score in papers, not the internal approx_bleu metric.\nt2t-bleu --translation=translation.en --reference=ref-translation.de\n\nInstallation\n# Assumes tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu installed\npip install tensor2tensor\n\n# Installs with tensorflow-gpu requirement\npip install tensor2tensor[tensorflow_gpu]\n\n# Installs with tensorflow (cpu) requirement\npip install tensor2tensor[tensorflow]\n\nBinaries:\n# Data generator\nt2t-datagen\n\n# Trainer\nt2t-trainer --registry_help\n\nLibrary usage:\npython -c \"from tensor2tensor.models.transformer import Transformer\"\n\nFeatures\n\nMany state of the art and baseline models are built-in and new models can be\nadded easily (open an issue or pull request!).\nMany datasets across modalities - text, audio, image - available for\ngeneration and use, and new ones can be added easily (open an issue or pull\nrequest for public datasets!).\nModels can be used with any dataset and input mode (or even multiple); all\nmodality-specific processing (e.g. embedding lookups for text tokens) is done\nwith bottom and top transformations, which are specified per-feature in the\nmodel.\nSupport for multi-GPU machines and synchronous (1 master, many workers) and\nasynchronous (independent workers synchronizing through a parameter server)\ndistributed training.\nEasily swap amongst datasets and models by command-line flag with the data\ngeneration script t2t-datagen and the training script t2t-trainer.\nTrain on Google Cloud ML and Cloud TPUs.\n\nT2T overview\nProblems\nProblems consist of features such as inputs and targets, and metadata such\nas each feature's modality (e.g. symbol, image, audio) and vocabularies. Problem\nfeatures are given by a dataset, which is stored as a TFRecord file with\ntensorflow.Example protocol buffers. All\nproblems are imported in\nall_problems.py\nor are registered with @registry.register_problem. Run\nt2t-datagen\nto see the list of available problems and download them.\nModels\nT2TModels define the core tensor-to-tensor computation. They apply a\ndefault transformation to each input and output so that models may deal with\nmodality-independent tensors (e.g. embeddings at the input; and a linear\ntransform at the output to produce logits for a softmax over classes). All\nmodels are imported in the\nmodels subpackage,\ninherit from T2TModel,\nand are registered with\n@registry.register_model.\nHyperparameter Sets\nHyperparameter sets are encoded in\nHParams\nobjects, and are registered with\n@registry.register_hparams.\nEvery model and problem has a HParams. A basic set of hyperparameters are\ndefined in\ncommon_hparams.py\nand hyperparameter set functions can compose other hyperparameter set functions.\nTrainer\nThe trainer binary is the entrypoint for training, evaluation, and\ninference. Users can easily switch between problems, models, and hyperparameter\nsets by using the --model, --problem, and --hparams_set flags. Specific\nhyperparameters can be overridden with the --hparams flag. --schedule and\nrelated flags control local and distributed training\/evaluation\n(distributed training documentation).\nAdding your own components\nT2T's components are registered using a central registration mechanism that\nenables easily adding new ones and easily swapping amongst them by command-line\nflag. You can add your own components without editing the T2T codebase by\nspecifying the --t2t_usr_dir flag in t2t-trainer.\nYou can do so for models, hyperparameter sets, modalities, and problems. Please\ndo submit a pull request if your component might be useful to others.\nSee the example_usr_dir\nfor an example user directory.\nAdding a dataset\nTo add a new dataset, subclass\nProblem\nand register it with @registry.register_problem. See\nTranslateEndeWmt8k\nfor an example. Also see the data generators\nREADME.\nRun on FloydHub\n\nClick this button to open a Workspace on FloydHub.

that you use?\nOr a cool file you want to sync?\n\nCreate a ~\/.mackup directory to sync an application or any file or directory\n\nWhy did you do this\nYesterday, I had a talk with Zach Zaro, complaining\nabout the pain it is to reconfigure our Macbook each time we get a new one or\ninstall from scratch. That's a talk we have already had months ago.\nI change my workstation every X months. Each time I either lose my apps'\nconfigurations, or I just waste a bunch of hours getting setup like I was on my\nold box. I also spend a lot of time reconfiguring the same stuff again on all my\nworkstations (home, work).\nBoring...\nSome people tried to solve the problem on the application layer, like Github's Boxen,\nbut it solves a different problem, from my point of view. I don't spend a lot\nof time installing or downloading stuff. I spend time configuring it.\nFor years, I've used a personal shell script that was copying known config\nfiles into Subversion, Git or Dropbox, and linked them into my home. But I felt\na lot of us had the same problem: Making a more generic tool could help others\nand I could get help from others to support more apps in the tool.\nSo here comes Mackup, the little tool that will sync all your application\nconfigs to Dropbox (or Google Drive, or anything).\nAnd it's GPL, of course.\nWhat platforms are supported\n\nOS X\nGNU\/Linux\n\nWhat's up with the weird name\nMackup is just a portmanteau of Mac and Backup. It is simple, short, and easy to\nremember, and it corresponds with the whole idea of Mackup: the simpler \u2013 the better!\n(And I suck at naming stuff, but who doesn't.)\nWhere can I find more information\nIn the doc directory.\n","183":"\nChatterBot\nChatterBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in\nPython which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of\nknown conversations. The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it\nto be trained to speak any language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of typical input would be something like this:\n\nuser: Good morning! How are you doing?\nbot:  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.\nuser: You're welcome.\nbot: Do you like hats?\n\nHow it works\nAn untrained instance of ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase. The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that statement based on how frequently each response is issued by the people the bot communicates with.\nInstallation\nThis package can be installed from PyPi by running:\npip install chatterbot\n\nBasic Usage\nfrom chatterbot import ChatBot\nfrom chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer\n\nchatbot = ChatBot('Ron Obvious')\n\n# Create a new trainer for the chatbot\ntrainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)\n\n# Train the chatbot based on the english corpus\ntrainer.train(\"chatterbot.corpus.english\")\n\n# Get a response to an input statement\nchatbot.get_response(\"Hello, how are you today?\")\n\nTraining data\nChatterBot comes with a data utility module that can be used to train chat bots.\nAt the moment there is training data for over a dozen languages in this module.\nContributions of additional training data or training data\nin other languages would be greatly appreciated.

Unfortunately, this cannot be done as part of the pip installation and should be manually downloaded from the wxPython website.\nUsage\nGooey is attached to your code via a simple decorator on whichever method has your argparse declarations (usually main).\nfrom gooey import Gooey\n\n@Gooey      <--- all it takes! :)\ndef main():\n  parser = ArgumentParser(...)\n  # rest of code\n\nDifferent styling and functionality can be configured by passing arguments into the decorator.\n# options\n@Gooey(advanced=Boolean,          # toggle whether to show advanced config or not \n       language=language_string,  # Translations configurable via json\n       auto_start=True,           # skip config screens all together\n       target=executable_cmd,     # Explicitly set the subprocess executable arguments\n       program_name='name',       # Defaults to script name\n       program_description,       # Defaults to ArgParse Description\n       default_size=(610, 530),   # starting size of the GUI\n       required_cols=1,           # number of columns in the \"Required\" section\n       optional_cols=2,           # number of columns in the \"Optional\" section\n       dump_build_config=False,   # Dump the JSON Gooey uses to configure itself\n       load_build_config=None,    # Loads a JSON Gooey-generated configuration\n       monospace_display=False)   # Uses a mono-spaced font in the output screen\n)\ndef main():\n  parser = ArgumentParser(...)\n  # rest of code\n\nSee: How does it Work section for details on each option.\nGooey will do its best to choose sensible widget defaults to display in the GUI. However, if more fine tuning is desired, you can use the drop-in replacement GooeyParser in place of ArgumentParser. This lets you control which widget displays in the GUI. See: GooeyParser\nfrom gooey import Gooey, GooeyParser\n\n@Gooey\ndef main():\n  parser = GooeyParser(description=\"My Cool GUI Program!\") \n  parser.add_argument('Filename', widget=\"FileChooser\")\n  parser.add_argument('Date', widget=\"DateChooser\")\n  ...\n\nExamples\nGooey downloaded and installed? Great! Wanna see it in action? Head over the the Examples Repository to download a few ready-to-go example scripts. They'll give you a quick tour of all Gooey's various layouts, widgets, and features.\nDirect Download\nWhat is it?\nGooey converts your Console Applications into end-user-friendly GUI applications. It lets you focus on building robust, configurable programs in a familiar way, all without having to worry about how it will be presented to and interacted with by your average user.\nWhy?\nBecause as much as we love the command prompt, the rest of the world looks at it like an ugly relic from the early '80s. On top of that, more often than not programs need to do more than just one thing, and that means giving options, which previously meant either building a GUI, or trying to explain how to supply arguments to a Console Application. Gooey was made to (hopefully) solve those problems. It makes programs easy to use, and pretty to look at!\nWho is this for?\nIf you're building utilities for yourself, other programmers, or something which produces a result that you want to capture and pipe over to another console application (e.g. *nix philosophy utils), Gooey probably isn't the tool for you. However, if you're building 'run and done,' around-the-office-style scripts, things that shovel bits from point A to point B, or simply something that's targeted at a non-programmer, Gooey is the perfect tool for the job. It lets you build as complex of an application as your heart desires all while getting the GUI side for free.\nHow does it work?\nGooey is attached to your code via a simple decorator on whichever method has your argparse declarations.\n@Gooey\ndef my_run_func():\n  parser = ArgumentParser(...)\n  # rest of code\n\nAt run-time, it parses your Python script for all references to ArgumentParser. (The older optparse is currently not supported.) These references are then extracted, assigned a component type based on the 'action' they provide, and finally used to assemble the GUI.\nMappings:\nGooey does its best to choose sensible defaults based on the options it finds. Currently, ArgumentParser._actions are mapped to the following WX components.\n\n\n\nParser Action\nWidget\nExample\n\n\n\n\nstore\nTextCtrl\n\n\n\nstore_const\nCheckBox\n\n\n\nstore_true\nCheckBox\n\n\n\nstore_False\nCheckBox\n\n\n\nappend\nTextCtrl\n\n\n\ncount\nDropDown \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nMutually Exclusive Group\nRadioGroup\n\n\n\nchoice \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDropDown\n\n\n\n\nGooeyParser\nIf the above defaults aren't cutting it, you can control the exact widget type by using the drop-in ArgumentParser replacement GooeyParser. This gives you the additional keyword argument widget, to which you can supply the name of the component you want to display. Best part? You don't have to change any of your argparse code to use it. Drop it in, and you're good to go.\nExample:\nfrom argparse import ArgumentParser\n....\n\ndef main(): \n    parser = ArgumentParser(description=\"My Cool Gooey App!\")\n    parser.add_argument('filename', help=\"name of the file to process\") \n\nGiven then above, Gooey would select a normal TextField as the widget type like this:\n\n\n\nHowever, by dropping in GooeyParser and supplying a widget name, you can display a much more user friendly FileChooser\nfrom gooey import GooeyParser\n....\n\ndef main(): \n    parser = GooeyParser(description=\"My Cool Gooey App!\")\n    parser.add_argument('filename', help=\"name of the file to process\", widget='FileChooser') \n\n\nCustom Widgets:\n\n\n\nWidget\nExample\n\n\n\n\nDirChooser, FileChooser, MultiFileChooser, FileSaver, MultiFileSaver\n\n\n\nDateChooser\/TimeChooser   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Please note that for both of these widgets the values passed to the application will always be in ISO format while localized values may appear in some parts of the GUI depending on end-user settings.\n\n\nPasswordField\n\n\n\nListbox\n\n\n\nBlockCheckbox\n  The default InlineCheck box can look less than ideal if a large help text block is present. BlockCheckbox moves the text block to the normal position and provides a short-form block_label for display next to the control. Use gooey_options.checkbox_label to control the label text\n\n\nColourChooser   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFilterableDropdown\n\n\n\n\nInternationalization\n\nGooey is international ready and easily ported to your host language.

However, these aren't always the most descriptive groups to present to your user. You can arbitrarily bucket inputs into logic groups and customize the layout of each.\nWith argparse this is done via add_argument_group()\n\nparser = ArgumentParser()\nsearch_group = parser.add_argument_group(\n    \"Search Options\", \n    \"Customize the search options\"\n)\n\nYou can add arguments to the group as normal\nsearch_group.add_argument(\n    '--query', \n    help='Base search string'\n) \n\nWhich will display them as part of the group within the UI.\nRun Modes\nGooey has a handful of presentation modes so you can tailor its layout to your content type and user's level or experience.\nAdvanced\nThe default view is the \"full\" or \"advanced\" configuration screen. It has two different layouts depending on the type of command line interface it's wrapping. For most applications, the flat layout will be the one to go with, as its layout matches best to the familiar CLI schema of a primary command followed by many options (e.g. Curl, FFMPEG).\nOn the other side is the Column Layout. This one is best suited for CLIs that have multiple paths or are made up of multiple little tools each with their own arguments and options (think: git). It displays the primary paths along the left column, and their corresponding arguments in the right. This is a great way to package a lot of varied functionality into a single app.\n\n\n\nBoth views present each action in the Argument Parser as a unique GUI component. It makes it ideal for presenting the program to users which are unfamiliar with command line options and\/or Console Programs in general. Help messages are displayed along side each component to make it as clear as possible which each widget does.\nSetting the layout style:\nCurrently, the layouts can't be explicitly specified via a parameter (on the TODO!). The layouts are built depending on whether or not there are subparsers used in your code base. So, if you want to trigger the Column Layout, you'll need to add a subparser to your argparse code.\nIt can be toggled via the advanced parameter in the Gooey decorator.\n@gooey(advanced=True)\ndef main():\n    # rest of code   \n\n\nBasic\nThe basic view is best for times when the user is familiar with Console Applications, but you still want to present something a little more polished than a simple terminal. The basic display is accessed by setting the advanced parameter in the gooey decorator to False.\n@gooey(advanced=False)\ndef main():\n    # rest of code  \n\n\n\n\n\nNo Config\nNo Config pretty much does what you'd expect: it doesn't show a configuration screen. It hops right to the display section and begins execution of the host program. This is the one for improving the appearance of little one-off scripts.\n\n\n\n\nMenus\n\n\nAdded 1.0.2\n\nYou can add a Menu Bar to the top of Gooey with customized menu groups and items.\nMenus are specified on the main @Gooey decorator as a list of maps.\n@Gooey(menu=[{}, {}, ...])\n\nEach map is made up of two key\/value pairs\n\nname - the name for this menu group\nitems - the individual menu items within this group\n\nYou can have as many menu groups as you want. They're passed as a list to the menu argument on the @Gooey decorator.\n@Gooey(menu=[{'name': 'File', 'items: []},\n             {'name': 'Tools', 'items': []},\n             {'name': 'Help', 'items': []}])\n\nIndividual menu items in a group are also just maps of key \/ value pairs. Their exact key set varies based on their type, but two keys will always be present:\n\ntype - this controls the behavior that will be attached to the menu item as well as the keys it needs specified\nmenuTitle - the name for this MenuItem\n\nCurrently, three types of menu options are supported:\n\nAboutDialog\nMessageDialog\nLink\n\n\nAbout Dialog is your run-of-the-mill About Dialog.

This functionality is experimental. Its API may be changed or removed altogether. Feedback\/thoughts on this feature is welcome and encouraged!\n\nGooey can optionally do some basic pre-flight validation on user input. Internally, it uses these validator functions to check for the presence of required arguments. However, by using GooeyParser, you can extend these functions with your own validation rules. This allows Gooey to show much, much more user friendly feedback before it hands control off to your program.\nWriting a validator:\nValidators are specified as part of the gooey_options map available to GooeyParser. It's a simple map structure made up of a root key named validator and two internal pairs:\n\ntest The inner body of the validation test you wish to perform\nmessage the error message that should display given a validation failure\n\ne.g.\ngooey_options={\n    'validator':{\n        'test': 'len(user_input) > 3',\n        'message': 'some helpful message'\n    }\n}\n\nThe test function\nYour test function can be made up of any valid Python expression. It receives the variable user_input as an argument against which to perform its validation. Note that all values coming from Gooey are in the form of a string, so you'll have to cast as needed in order to perform your validation.\nFull Code Example\nfrom gooey.python_bindings.gooey_decorator import Gooey\nfrom gooey.python_bindings.gooey_parser import GooeyParser\n\n@Gooey\ndef main():\n    parser = GooeyParser(description='Example validator')\n    parser.add_argument(\n        'secret',\n        metavar='Super Secret Number',\n        help='A number specifically between 2 and 14',\n        gooey_options={\n            'validator': {\n                'test': '2 <= int(user_input) <= 14',\n                'message': 'Must be between 2 and 14'\n            }\n        })\n\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    print(\"Cool! Your secret number is: \", args.secret)\n\n\nWith the validator in place, Gooey can present the error messages next to the relevant input field if any validators fail.\n\nUsing Dynamic Values\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\nNote! This functionality is experimental. Its API may be changed or removed altogether. Feedback on this feature is welcome and encouraged!\n\nGooey's Choice style fields (Dropdown, Listbox) can be fed a dynamic set of values at runtime by enabling the poll_external_updates option. This will cause Gooey to request updated values from your program every time the user visits the Configuration page. This can be used to, for instance, show the result of a previous execution on the config screen without requiring that the user restart the program.\nHow does it work?\n\nAt runtime, whenever the user hits the Configuration screen, Gooey will call your program with a single CLI argument: gooey-seed-ui. This is a request to your program for updated values for the UI. In response to this, on stdout, your program should return a JSON string mapping cli-inputs to a list of options.\nFor example, assuming a setup where you have a dropdown that lists user files:\n ...\n parser.add_argument(\n        '--load',\n        metavar='Load Previous Save',\n        help='Load a Previous save file',\n        dest='filename',\n        widget='Dropdown',\n        choices=list_savefiles(),\n    )\n\nHere the input we want to populate is --load. So, in response to the gooey-seed-ui request, you would return a JSON string with --load as the key, and a list of strings that you'd like to display to the user as the value. e.g.\n{\"--load\": [\"Filename_1.txt\", \"filename_2.txt\", ..., \"filename_n.txt]}\n\nCheckout the full example code in the Examples Repository. Or checkout a larger example in the silly little tool that spawned this feature: SavingOverIt.\n\nShowing Progress\n\nGiving visual progress feedback with Gooey is easy! If you're already displaying textual progress updates, you can tell Gooey to hook into that existing output in order to power its Progress Bar.\nFor simple cases, output strings which resolve to a numeric representation of the completion percentage (e.g. Progress 83%) can be pattern matched and turned into a progress bar status with a simple regular expression (e.g. @Gooey(progress_regex=r\"^progress: (\\d+)%$\")).\nFor more complicated outputs, you can pass in a custom evaluation expression (progress_expr) to transform regular expression matches as needed.\nOutput strings which satisfy the regular expression can be hidden from the console via the hide_progress_msg parameter (e.g. @Gooey(progress_regex=r\"^progress: (\\d+)%$\", hide_progress_msg=True).\nRegex and Processing Expression\n@Gooey(progress_regex=r\"^progress: (?P<current>\\d+)\/(?P<total>\\d+)$\",\n       progress_expr=\"current \/ total * 100\")\nProgram Output:\nprogress: 1\/100\nprogress: 2\/100\nprogress: 3\/100\n...\n\nThere are lots of options for telling Gooey about progress as your program is running. Checkout the Gooey Examples repository for more detailed usage and examples!\nElapsed \/ Remaining Time\nGooey also supports tracking elapsed \/ remaining time when progress is used! This is done in a similar manner to that of the project tqdm. This can be enabled with timing_options, the timing_options argument takes in a dictionary with the keys show_time_remaining and hide_time_remaining_on_complete. The default behavior is True for show_time_remaining and False for hide_time_remaining_on_complete. This will only work when progress_regex and progress_expr are used.\n@Gooey(progress_regex=r\"^progress: (?P<current>\\d+)\/(?P<total>\\d+)$\",\n       progress_expr=\"current \/ total * 100\",\n       timing_options = {\n        'show_time_remaining':True,\n        'hide_time_remaining_on_complete':True,\n    })\n\n\nCustomizing Icons\nGooey comes with a set of six default icons. These can be overridden with your own custom images\/icons by telling Gooey to search additional directories when initializing. This is done via the image_dir argument to the Gooey decorator.\n@Gooey(program_name='Custom icon demo', image_dir='\/path\/to\/my\/image\/directory')\ndef main():\n    # rest of program\n\nImages are discovered by Gooey based on their filenames. So, for example, in order to supply a custom configuration icon, simply place an image with the filename config_icon.png in your images directory. These are the filenames which can be overridden:\n\nprogram_icon.png\nsuccess_icon.png\nrunning_icon.png\nloading_icon.gif\nconfig_icon.png\nerror_icon.png\n\nPackaging\nThanks to some awesome contributers, packaging Gooey as an executable is super easy.\nThe tl;dr pyinstaller version is to drop this build.spec into the root directory of your application. Edit its contents so that the application and name are relevant to your project, then execute pyinstaller build.spec to bundle your app into a ready-to-go executable.\nDetailed step by step instructions can be found here.\nScreenshots\n\n\n\nFlat Layout\nColumn Layout\nSuccess Screen\nError Screen\nWarning Dialog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Groups\nTabbed Groups\nTabbed Navigation\nSidebar Navigation\nInput Validation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWanna help?\nCode, translation, documentation, or graphics?

If you are a company that is deeply\ncommitted to using open source technologies in artificial intelligence, machine, and deep learning, and want to support\nthe communities of open source projects in these domains, consider joining the LF AI Foundation.

This has two aspects:\n\nHow much modification does one have to make to a program to make it distributed, and how easy is it to run it?\nHow much faster would it run in distributed mode?\n\nInternally at Uber we found the MPI model to be much more straightforward and require far less code changes than previous\nsolutions such as Distributed TensorFlow with parameter servers. Once a training script has been written for scale with\nHorovod, it can run on a single-GPU, multiple-GPUs, or even multiple hosts without any further code changes.\nSee the Usage section for more details.\nIn addition to being easy to use, Horovod is fast. Below is a chart representing the benchmark that was done on 128\nservers with 4 Pascal GPUs each connected by RoCE-capable 25 Gbit\/s network:\n\nHorovod achieves 90% scaling efficiency for both Inception V3 and ResNet-101, and 68% scaling efficiency for VGG-16.\nSee Benchmarks to find out how to reproduce these numbers.\nWhile installing MPI and NCCL itself may seem like an extra hassle, it only needs to be done once by the team dealing\nwith infrastructure, while everyone else in the company who builds the models can enjoy the simplicity of training them at\nscale.\n\nInstall\nTo install Horovod:\n\nInstall CMake\n\n\nIf you've installed TensorFlow from PyPI, make sure that the g++-4.8.5 or g++-4.9 is installed.\nIf you've installed PyTorch from PyPI, make sure that the g++-4.9 or above is installed.\nIf you've installed either package from Conda, make sure that the gxx_linux-64 Conda package is installed.\n\n\n\nInstall the horovod pip package.\nTo run on CPUs:\n$ pip install horovod\nTo run on GPUs with NCCL:\n$ HOROVOD_GPU_OPERATIONS=NCCL pip install horovod\n\n\nFor more details on installing Horovod with GPU support, read Horovod on GPU.\nFor the full list of Horovod installation options, read the Installation Guide.\nIf you want to use MPI, read Horovod with MPI.\nIf you want to use Conda, read Building a Conda environment with GPU support for Horovod.\nIf you want to use Docker, read Horovod in Docker.\nTo compile Horovod from source, follow the instructions in the Contributor Guide.\n\nConcepts\nHorovod core principles are based on MPI concepts such as size, rank,\nlocal rank, allreduce, allgather and, broadcast. See this page for more details.\n\nSupported frameworks\nSee these pages for Horovod examples and best practices:\n\nHorovod with TensorFlow\nHorovod with Keras\nHorovod with PyTorch\nHorovod with MXNet\n\n\nUsage\nTo use Horovod, make the following additions to your program:\n\nRun hvd.init() to initialize Horovod.\n\n\nPin each GPU to a single process to avoid resource contention.\nWith the typical setup of one GPU per process, set this to local rank. The first process on\nthe server will be allocated the first GPU, the second process will be allocated the second GPU, and so forth.\n\n\n\nScale the learning rate by the number of workers.\nEffective batch size in synchronous distributed training is scaled by the number of workers.\nAn increase in learning rate compensates for the increased batch size.\n\n\n\nWrap the optimizer in hvd.DistributedOptimizer.\nThe distributed optimizer delegates gradient computation to the original optimizer, averages gradients using allreduce or allgather, and then applies those averaged gradients.\n\n\n\nBroadcast the initial variable states from rank 0 to all other processes.\nThis is necessary to ensure consistent initialization of all workers when training is started with random weights or restored from a checkpoint.\n\n\n\nModify your code to save checkpoints only on worker 0 to prevent other workers from corrupting them.\n\nExample using TensorFlow v1 (see the examples directory for full training examples):\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport horovod.tensorflow as hvd\n\n\n# Initialize Horovod\nhvd.init()\n\n# Pin GPU to be used to process local rank (one GPU per process)\nconfig = tf.ConfigProto()\nconfig.gpu_options.visible_device_list = str(hvd.local_rank())\n\n# Build model...\nloss = ...\nopt = tf.train.AdagradOptimizer(0.01 * hvd.size())\n\n# Add Horovod Distributed Optimizer\nopt = hvd.DistributedOptimizer(opt)\n\n# Add hook to broadcast variables from rank 0 to all other processes during\n# initialization.\nhooks = [hvd.BroadcastGlobalVariablesHook(0)]\n\n# Make training operation\ntrain_op = opt.minimize(loss)\n\n# Save checkpoints only on worker 0 to prevent other workers from corrupting them.\ncheckpoint_dir = '\/tmp\/train_logs' if hvd.rank() == 0 else None\n\n# The MonitoredTrainingSession takes care of session initialization,\n# restoring from a checkpoint, saving to a checkpoint, and closing when done\n# or an error occurs.\nwith tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(checkpoint_dir=checkpoint_dir,\n                                       config=config,\n                                       hooks=hooks) as mon_sess:\n  while not mon_sess.should_stop():\n    # Perform synchronous training.\n    mon_sess.run(train_op)\n\nRunning Horovod\nThe example commands below show how to run distributed training.\nSee Run Horovod for more details, including RoCE\/InfiniBand tweaks and tips for dealing with hangs.\n\nTo run on a machine with 4 GPUs:\n$ horovodrun -np 4 -H localhost:4 python train.py\n\nTo run on 4 machines with 4 GPUs each:\n$ horovodrun -np 16 -H server1:4,server2:4,server3:4,server4:4 python train.py\n\nTo run using Open MPI without the horovodrun wrapper, see Running Horovod with Open MPI.\n\nTo run in Docker, see Horovod in Docker.\n\nTo run in Kubernetes, see Kubeflow, MPI Operator, Helm Chart, FfDL, and Polyaxon.\n\nTo run on Spark, see Horovod on Spark.\n\nTo run on Ray, see Horovod on Ray.\n\nTo run in Singularity, see Singularity.\n\nTo run in a LSF HPC cluster (e.g. Summit), see LSF.\n\n\n\nGloo\nGloo is an open source collective communications library developed by Facebook.\nGloo comes included with Horovod, and allows users to run Horovod without requiring MPI to be installed.\nFor environments that have support both MPI and Gloo, you can choose to use Gloo at runtime by passing the --gloo argument to horovodrun:\n$ horovodrun --gloo -np 2 python train.py\n\nmpi4py\nHorovod supports mixing and matching Horovod collectives with other MPI libraries, such as mpi4py,\nprovided that the MPI was built with multi-threading support.\nYou can check for MPI multi-threading support by querying the hvd.mpi_threads_supported() function.\nimport horovod.tensorflow as hvd\n\n# Initialize Horovod\nhvd.init()\n\n# Verify that MPI multi-threading is supported.\nassert hvd.mpi_threads_supported()\n\nfrom mpi4py import MPI\nassert hvd.size() == MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size()\nYou can also initialize Horovod with an mpi4py sub-communicator, in which case each sub-communicator\nwill run an independent Horovod training.\nfrom mpi4py import MPI\nimport horovod.tensorflow as hvd\n\n# Split COMM_WORLD into subcommunicators\nsubcomm = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Split(color=MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank % 2,\n                               key=MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank)\n\n# Initialize Horovod\nhvd.init(comm=subcomm)\n\nprint('COMM_WORLD rank: %d, Horovod rank: %d' % (MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank, hvd.rank()))\n\nInference\nLearn how to optimize your model for inference and remove Horovod operations from the graph here.\n\nTensor Fusion\nOne of the unique things about Horovod is its ability to interleave communication and computation coupled with the ability\nto batch small allreduce operations, which results in improved performance. We call this batching feature Tensor Fusion.\nSee here for full details and tweaking instructions.\n\nHorovod Timeline\nHorovod has the ability to record the timeline of its activity, called Horovod Timeline.\n\nUse Horovod timeline to analyze Horovod performance.\nSee here for full details and usage instructions.\n\nAutomated Performance Tuning\nSelecting the right values to efficiently make use of Tensor Fusion and other advanced Horovod features can involve\na good amount of trial and error. We provide a system to automate this performance optimization process called\nautotuning, which you can enable with a single command line argument to horovodrun.\nSee here for full details and usage instructions.\n\nGuides\n\nRun distributed training in Microsoft Azure using Batch AI and Horovod.\nDistributed model training using Horovod.\n\nSend us links to any user guides you want to publish on this site\n\nTroubleshooting\nSee Troubleshooting and submit a ticket\nif you can't find an answer.\n\nCitation\nPlease cite Horovod in your publications if it helps your research:\n@article{sergeev2018horovod,\n  Author = {Alexander Sergeev and Mike Del Balso},\n  Journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.05799},\n  Title = {Horovod: fast and easy distributed deep learning in {TensorFlow}},\n  Year = {2018}\n}\n\n\nPublications\n1.

Google web service dependency\nHelp is welcome! See the docs\/contributing.md document for more information.\nObjectives\nIn descending order of significance (i.e. most important objective first):\n\nungoogled-chromium is Google Chromium, sans dependency on Google web services.\nungoogled-chromium retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible. Unlike other Chromium forks that have their own visions of a web browser, ungoogled-chromium is essentially a drop-in replacement for Chromium.\nungoogled-chromium features tweaks to enhance privacy, control, and transparency. However, almost all of these features must be manually activated or enabled. For more details, see Feature Overview.\n\nIn scenarios where the objectives conflict, the objective of higher significance should take precedence.\nContent Overview\n\nObjectives\nMotivation and Philosophy\nFeature Overview\nDownloads\nSource Code\nFAQ\nBuilding Instructions\nDesign Documentation\nContributing, Reporting, Contacting\nCredits\nRelated Projects\nLicense\n\nMotivation and Philosophy\nWithout signing in to a Google Account, Chromium does pretty well in terms of security and privacy. However, Chromium still has some dependency on Google web services and binaries. In addition, Google designed Chromium to be easy and intuitive for users, which means they compromise on transparency and control of internal operations.\nungoogled-chromium addresses these issues in the following ways:\n\nRemove all remaining background requests to any web services while building and running the browser\nRemove all code specific to Google web services\nRemove all uses of pre-made binaries from the source code, and replace them with user-provided alternatives when possible.\nDisable features that inhibit control and transparency, and add or modify features that promote them (these changes will almost always require manual activation or enabling).\n\nThese features are implemented as configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts. For more details, consult the Design Documentation.\nFeature Overview\nThis section overviews the features of ungoogled-chromium. For more detailed information, it is best to consult the source code.\nContents of this section:\n\nKey Features\nEnhancing Features\nBorrowed Features\nSupported Platforms and Distributions\n\nKey Features\nThese are the core features introduced by ungoogled-chromium.\n\nDisable functionality specific to Google domains (e.g. Google Host Detector, Google URL Tracker, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Hotwording, etc.)\n\nThis includes disabling Safe Browsing. Consult the FAQ for the rationale.\n\n\nBlock internal requests to Google at runtime. This feature is a fail-safe measure for the above, in case Google changes or introduces new components that our patches do not disable. This feature is implemented by replacing many Google web domains in the source code with non-existent alternatives ending in qjz9zk (known as domain substitution; see docs\/design.md for details), then modifying Chromium to block its own requests with such domains. In other words, no connections are attempted to the qjz9zk domain.\nStrip binaries from the source code (known as binary pruning; see docs\/design.md for details)\nAdd many new command-line switches and chrome:\/\/flags entries to configure disabled-by-default features.

If you are looking for\ninformation about the AWS CLI version 2, please visit the v2\nbranch.\n\nRequirements\nThe aws-cli package works on Python versions:\n\n2.7.x and greater\n3.4.x and greater\n3.5.x and greater\n3.6.x and greater\n3.7.x and greater\n3.8.x and greater\n\nOn 10\/09\/2019 support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 was deprecated and\nsupport was dropped on 01\/10\/2020. To avoid disruption, customers using\nthe AWS CLI on Python 2.6 or 3.3 will need to upgrade their version of\nPython or pin the version of the AWS CLI in use prior to 01\/10\/2020. For\nmore information, see this blog\npost.\nAttention!\nWe recommend that all customers regularly monitor the Amazon Web\nServices Security Bulletins\nwebsite for\nany important security bulletins related to aws-cli.\n\nInstallation\nThe safest way to install the AWS CLI is to use\npip in a virtualenv:\n$ python -m pip install awscli\n\nor, if you are not installing in a virtualenv, to install globally:\n$ sudo python -m pip install awscli\n\nor for your user:\n$ python -m pip install --user awscli\n\nIf you have the aws-cli package installed and want to upgrade to the\nlatest version you can run:\n$ python -m pip install --upgrade awscli\n\nThis will install the aws-cli package as well as all dependencies.\n\nNote\nOn macOS, if you see an error regarding the version of six that\ncame with distutils in El Capitan, use the --ignore-installed\noption:\n\n$ sudo python -m pip install awscli --ignore-installed six\n\nOn Linux and Mac OS, the AWS CLI can be installed using a bundled\ninstaller.\nThe AWS CLI can also be installed on Windows via an MSI\nInstaller.\nIf you want to run the develop branch of the AWS CLI, see the\nDevelopment Version section of\nthe contributing guide.\nSee the\ninstallation\nsection of the AWS CLI User Guide for more information.\n\nConfiguration\nBefore using the AWS CLI, you need to configure your AWS credentials.\nYou can do this in several ways:\n\nConfiguration command\nEnvironment variables\nShared credentials file\nConfig file\nIAM Role\n\nThe quickest way to get started is to run the aws configure command:\n$ aws configure\nAWS Access Key ID: MYACCESSKEY\nAWS Secret Access Key: MYSECRETKEY\nDefault region name [us-west-2]: us-west-2\nDefault output format [None]: json\n\nTo use environment variables, do the following:\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key>\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_key>\n\nTo use the shared credentials file, create an INI formatted file like\nthis:\n[default]\naws_access_key_id=MYACCESSKEY\naws_secret_access_key=MYSECRETKEY\n\n[testing]\naws_access_key_id=MYACCESKEY\naws_secret_access_key=MYSECRETKEY\n\nand place it in ~\/.aws\/credentials (or in\n%UserProfile%\\.aws\/credentials on Windows). If you wish to place the\nshared credentials file in a different location than the one specified\nabove, you need to tell aws-cli where to find it. Do this by setting the\nappropriate environment variable:\n$ export AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=\/path\/to\/shared_credentials_file\n\nTo use a config file, create an INI formatted file like this:\n[default]\naws_access_key_id=<default access key>\naws_secret_access_key=<default secret key>\n# Optional, to define default region for this profile.\nregion=us-west-1\n\n[profile testing]\naws_access_key_id=<testing access key>\naws_secret_access_key=<testing secret key>\nregion=us-west-2\n\nand place it in ~\/.aws\/config (or in %UserProfile%\\.aws\\config\non Windows). If you wish to place the config file in a different\nlocation than the one specified above, you need to tell the AWS CLI\nwhere to find it. Do this by setting the appropriate environment\nvariable:\n$ export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=\/path\/to\/config_file\n\nAs you can see, you can have multiple profiles defined in both the\nshared credentials file and the configuration file. You can then specify\nwhich profile to use by using the --profile option. If no profile is\nspecified the default profile is used.\nIn the config file, except for the default profile, you must prefix\neach config section of a profile group with profile. For example, if\nyou have a profile named \"testing\" the section header would be\n[profile testing].\nThe final option for credentials is highly recommended if you are using\nthe AWS CLI on an EC2 instance. IAM\nRoles\nare a great way to have credentials installed automatically on your\ninstance. If you are using IAM Roles, the AWS CLI will find and use them\nautomatically.\nIn addition to credentials, a number of other variables can be\nconfigured either with environment variables, configuration file\nentries, or both. See the AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and\nCredentials Reference\nGuide\nfor more information.\nFor more information about configuration options, please refer to the\nAWS CLI Configuration Variables\ntopic.\nYou can access this topic from the AWS CLI as well by running\naws help config-vars.\n\nBasic Commands\nAn AWS CLI command has the following structure:\n$ aws <command> <subcommand> [options and parameters]\n\nFor example, to list S3 buckets, the command would be:\n$ aws s3 ls\n\nTo view help documentation, use one of the following:\n$ aws help\n$ aws <command> help\n$ aws <command> <subcommand> help\n\nTo get the version of the AWS CLI:\n$ aws --version\n\nTo turn on debugging output:\n$ aws --debug <command> <subcommand>\n\nYou can read more information on the Using the AWS\nCLI\nchapter of the AWS CLI User Guide.\n\nCommand Completion\nThe aws-cli package includes a command completion feature for Unix-like\nsystems. This feature is not automatically installed so you need to\nconfigure it manually. To learn more, read the AWS CLI Command\ncompletion\ntopic.\n\nGetting Help\nThe best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. You can open\nan issue and\nchoose from one of our templates for guidance, bug reports, or feature\nrequests.\nYou may find help from the community on Stack\nOverflow with the tag\naws-cli or on\nthe AWS Discussion Forum for\nCLI. If you\nhave a support plan with AWS Premium\nSupport, you can also create\na new support case.\nPlease check for open similar\nissues before opening\nanother one.\nThe AWS CLI implements AWS service APIs. For general issues regarding\nthe services or their limitations, you may find the Amazon Web Services\nDiscussion Forums helpful.\n\nMore Resources\n\nChangelog\nAWS CLI\nDocumentation\nAWS CLI User\nGuide\nAWS CLI Command\nReference\nAmazon Web Services Discussion\nForums\nAWS Support\n\n","193":"StyleGAN \u2014 Official TensorFlow Implementation\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture: These people are not real \u2013 they were produced by our generator that allows control over different aspects of the image.\nThis repository contains the official TensorFlow implementation of the following paper:\n\nA Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks\nTero Karras (NVIDIA), Samuli Laine (NVIDIA), Timo Aila (NVIDIA)\nhttps:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1812.04948\nAbstract: We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and high-quality dataset of human faces.\n\nFor business inquiries, please contact researchinquiries@nvidia.com\nFor press and other inquiries, please contact Hector Marinez at hmarinez@nvidia.com\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 NEW: StyleGAN2 is available at https:\/\/github.com\/NVlabs\/stylegan2 \u2605\u2605\u2605\nResources\nMaterial related to our paper is available via the following links:\n\nPaper: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1812.04948\nVideo: https:\/\/youtu.be\/kSLJriaOumA\nCode: https:\/\/github.com\/NVlabs\/stylegan\nFFHQ: https:\/\/github.com\/NVlabs\/ffhq-dataset\n\nAdditional material can be found on Google Drive:\n\n\n\nPath\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nStyleGAN\nMain folder.\n\n\n\u251c\u00a0 stylegan-paper.pdf\nHigh-quality version of the paper PDF.\n\n\n\u251c\u00a0 stylegan-video.mp4\nHigh-quality version of the result video.\n\n\n\u251c\u00a0 images\nExample images produced using our generator.\n\n\n\u2502\u00a0 \u251c\u00a0 representative-images\nHigh-quality images to be used in articles, blog posts, etc.\n\n\n\u2502\u00a0 \u2514\u00a0 100k-generated-images\n100,000 generated images for different amounts of truncation.\n\n\n\u2502\u00a0 \u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 ffhq-1024x1024\nGenerated using Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset at 1024\u00d71024.\n\n\n\u2502\u00a0 \u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 bedrooms-256x256\nGenerated using LSUN Bedroom dataset at 256\u00d7256.\n\n\n\u2502\u00a0 \u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 cars-512x384\nGenerated using LSUN Car dataset at 512\u00d7384.\n\n\n\u2502\u00a0 \u2002\u2002 \u2514\u00a0 cats-256x256\nGenerated using LSUN Cat dataset at 256\u00d7256.\n\n\n\u251c\u00a0 videos\nExample videos produced using our generator.\n\n\n\u2502\u00a0 \u2514\u00a0 high-quality-video-clips\nIndividual segments of the result video as high-quality MP4.\n\n\n\u251c\u00a0 ffhq-dataset\nRaw data for the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset.\n\n\n\u2514\u00a0 networks\nPre-trained networks as pickled instances of dnnlib.tflib.Network.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 stylegan-ffhq-1024x1024.pkl\nStyleGAN trained with Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset at 1024\u00d71024.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 stylegan-celebahq-1024x1024.pkl\nStyleGAN trained with CelebA-HQ dataset at 1024\u00d71024.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 stylegan-bedrooms-256x256.pkl\nStyleGAN trained with LSUN Bedroom dataset at 256\u00d7256.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 stylegan-cars-512x384.pkl\nStyleGAN trained with LSUN Car dataset at 512\u00d7384.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 stylegan-cats-256x256.pkl\nStyleGAN trained with LSUN Cat dataset at 256\u00d7256.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u2514\u00a0 metrics\nAuxiliary networks for the quality and disentanglement metrics.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 inception_v3_features.pkl\nStandard Inception-v3 classifier that outputs a raw feature vector.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 vgg16_zhang_perceptual.pkl\nStandard LPIPS metric to estimate perceptual similarity.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u2002\u2002 \u251c\u00a0 celebahq-classifier-00-male.pkl\nBinary classifier trained to detect a single attribute of CelebA-HQ.\n\n\n\u2002\u2002 \u2002\u2002 \u2514\u00a0\u22ef\nPlease see the file listing for remaining networks.\n\n\n\nLicenses\nAll material, excluding the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset, is made available under Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 license by NVIDIA Corporation.

Mainly useful for resuming a previous training run.\n    # _D = Instantaneous snapshot of the discriminator. Mainly useful for resuming a previous training run.\n    # Gs = Long-term average of the generator. Yields higher-quality results than the instantaneous snapshot.\n\nThe above code downloads the file and unpickles it to yield 3 instances of dnnlib.tflib.Network. To generate images, you will typically want to use Gs \u2013 the other two networks are provided for completeness. In order for pickle.load() to work, you will need to have the dnnlib source directory in your PYTHONPATH and a tf.Session set as default. The session can initialized by calling dnnlib.tflib.init_tf().\nThere are three ways to use the pre-trained generator:\n\n\nUse Gs.run() for immediate-mode operation where the inputs and outputs are numpy arrays:\n# Pick latent vector.\nrnd = np.random.RandomState(5)\nlatents = rnd.randn(1, Gs.input_shape[1])\n\n# Generate image.\nfmt = dict(func=tflib.convert_images_to_uint8, nchw_to_nhwc=True)\nimages = Gs.run(latents, None, truncation_psi=0.7, randomize_noise=True, output_transform=fmt)\n\nThe first argument is a batch of latent vectors of shape [num, 512]. The second argument is reserved for class labels (not used by StyleGAN). The remaining keyword arguments are optional and can be used to further modify the operation (see below). The output is a batch of images, whose format is dictated by the output_transform argument.\n\n\nUse Gs.get_output_for() to incorporate the generator as a part of a larger TensorFlow expression:\nlatents = tf.random_normal([self.minibatch_per_gpu] + Gs_clone.input_shape[1:])\nimages = Gs_clone.get_output_for(latents, None, is_validation=True, randomize_noise=True)\nimages = tflib.convert_images_to_uint8(images)\nresult_expr.append(inception_clone.get_output_for(images))\n\nThe above code is from metrics\/frechet_inception_distance.py. It generates a batch of random images and feeds them directly to the Inception-v3 network without having to convert the data to numpy arrays in between.\n\n\nLook up Gs.components.mapping and Gs.components.synthesis to access individual sub-networks of the generator. Similar to Gs, the sub-networks are represented as independent instances of dnnlib.tflib.Network:\nsrc_latents = np.stack(np.random.RandomState(seed).randn(Gs.input_shape[1]) for seed in src_seeds)\nsrc_dlatents = Gs.components.mapping.run(src_latents, None) # [seed, layer, component]\nsrc_images = Gs.components.synthesis.run(src_dlatents, randomize_noise=False, **synthesis_kwargs)\n\nThe above code is from generate_figures.py. It first transforms a batch of latent vectors into the intermediate W space using the mapping network and then turns these vectors into a batch of images using the synthesis network. The dlatents array stores a separate copy of the same w vector for each layer of the synthesis network to facilitate style mixing.\n\n\nThe exact details of the generator are defined in training\/networks_stylegan.py (see G_style, G_mapping, and G_synthesis). The following keyword arguments can be specified to modify the behavior when calling run() and get_output_for():\n\n\ntruncation_psi and truncation_cutoff control the truncation trick that that is performed by default when using Gs (\u03c8=0.7, cutoff=8). It can be disabled by setting truncation_psi=1 or is_validation=True, and the image quality can be further improved at the cost of variation by setting e.g. truncation_psi=0.5. Note that truncation is always disabled when using the sub-networks directly. The average w needed to manually perform the truncation trick can be looked up using Gs.get_var('dlatent_avg').\n\n\nrandomize_noise determines whether to use re-randomize the noise inputs for each generated image (True, default) or whether to use specific noise values for the entire minibatch (False). The specific values can be accessed via the tf.Variable instances that are found using [var for name, var in Gs.components.synthesis.vars.items() if name.startswith('noise')].\n\n\nWhen using the mapping network directly, you can specify dlatent_broadcast=None to disable the automatic duplication of dlatents over the layers of the synthesis network.\n\n\nRuntime performance can be fine-tuned via structure='fixed' and dtype='float16'. The former disables support for progressive growing, which is not needed for a fully-trained generator, and the latter performs all computation using half-precision floating point arithmetic.\n\n\nPreparing datasets for training\nThe training and evaluation scripts operate on datasets stored as multi-resolution TFRecords. Each dataset is represented by a directory containing the same image data in several resolutions to enable efficient streaming. There is a separate *.tfrecords file for each resolution, and if the dataset contains labels, they are stored in a separate file as well. By default, the scripts expect to find the datasets at datasets\/<NAME>\/<NAME>-<RESOLUTION>.tfrecords. The directory can be changed by editing config.py:\nresult_dir = 'results'\ndata_dir = 'datasets'\ncache_dir = 'cache'\n\nTo obtain the FFHQ dataset (datasets\/ffhq), please refer to the Flickr-Faces-HQ repository.\nTo obtain the CelebA-HQ dataset (datasets\/celebahq), please refer to the Progressive GAN repository.\nTo obtain other datasets, including LSUN, please consult their corresponding project pages.

It can differentiate through loops, branches,\nrecursion, and closures, and it can take derivatives of derivatives of\nderivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation)\nvia grad as well as forward-mode differentiation,\nand the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order.\nWhat\u2019s new is that JAX uses\nXLA\nto compile and run your NumPy programs on GPUs and TPUs. Compilation happens\nunder the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and\nexecuted. But JAX also lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions\ninto XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API,\njit. Compilation and automatic differentiation can be\ncomposed arbitrarily, so you can express sophisticated algorithms and get\nmaximal performance without leaving Python. You can even program multiple GPUs\nor TPU cores at once using pmap, and\ndifferentiate through the whole thing.\nDig a little deeper, and you'll see that JAX is really an extensible system for\ncomposable function transformations. Both\ngrad and jit\nare instances of such transformations. Others are\nvmap for automatic vectorization and\npmap for single-program multiple-data (SPMD)\nparallel programming of multiple accelerators, with more to come.\nThis is a research project, not an official Google product. Expect bugs and\nsharp edges.\nPlease help by trying it out, reporting\nbugs, and letting us know what you\nthink!\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nfrom jax import grad, jit, vmap\n\ndef predict(params, inputs):\n  for W, b in params:\n    outputs = jnp.dot(inputs, W) + b\n    inputs = jnp.tanh(outputs)\n  return outputs\n\ndef logprob_fun(params, inputs, targets):\n  preds = predict(params, inputs)\n  return jnp.sum((preds - targets)**2)\n\ngrad_fun = jit(grad(logprob_fun))  # compiled gradient evaluation function\nperex_grads = jit(vmap(grad_fun, in_axes=(None, 0, 0)))  # fast per-example grads\nContents\n\nQuickstart: Colab in the Cloud\nTransformations\nCurrent gotchas\nInstallation\nNeural net libraries\nCiting JAX\nReference documentation\n\nQuickstart: Colab in the Cloud\nJump right in using a notebook in your browser, connected to a Google Cloud GPU.\nHere are some starter notebooks:\n\nThe basics: NumPy on accelerators, grad for differentiation, jit for compilation, and vmap for vectorization\nTraining a Simple Neural Network, with TensorFlow Dataset Data Loading\n\nJAX now runs on Cloud TPUs. To try out the preview, see the Cloud TPU\nColabs.\nFor a deeper dive into JAX:\n\nThe Autodiff Cookbook, Part 1: easy and powerful automatic differentiation in JAX\nCommon gotchas and sharp edges\nSee the full list of\nnotebooks.\n\nYou can also take a look at the mini-libraries in\njax.experimental,\nlike stax for building neural\nnetworks\nand optimizers for first-order stochastic\noptimization,\nor the examples.\nTransformations\nAt its core, JAX is an extensible system for transforming numerical functions.\nHere are four of primary interest: grad, jit, vmap, and pmap.\nAutomatic differentiation with grad\nJAX has roughly the same API as Autograd.\nThe most popular function is\ngrad\nfor reverse-mode gradients:\nfrom jax import grad\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef tanh(x):  # Define a function\n  y = jnp.exp(-2.0 * x)\n  return (1.0 - y) \/ (1.0 + y)\n\ngrad_tanh = grad(tanh)  # Obtain its gradient function\nprint(grad_tanh(1.0))   # Evaluate it at x = 1.0\n# prints 0.4199743\nYou can differentiate to any order with grad.\nprint(grad(grad(grad(tanh)))(1.0))\n# prints 0.62162673\nFor more advanced autodiff, you can use\njax.vjp for\nreverse-mode vector-Jacobian products and\njax.jvp for\nforward-mode Jacobian-vector products. The two can be composed arbitrarily with\none another, and with other JAX transformations. Here's one way to compose those\nto make a function that efficiently computes full Hessian\nmatrices:\nfrom jax import jit, jacfwd, jacrev\n\ndef hessian(fun):\n  return jit(jacfwd(jacrev(fun)))\nAs with Autograd, you're free to use\ndifferentiation with Python control structures:\ndef abs_val(x):\n  if x > 0:\n    return x\n  else:\n    return -x\n\nabs_val_grad = grad(abs_val)\nprint(abs_val_grad(1.0))   # prints 1.0\nprint(abs_val_grad(-1.0))  # prints -1.0 (abs_val is re-evaluated)\nSee the reference docs on automatic\ndifferentiation\nand the JAX Autodiff\nCookbook\nfor more.\nCompilation with jit\nYou can use XLA to compile your functions end-to-end with\njit,\nused either as an @jit decorator or as a higher-order function.\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nfrom jax import jit\n\ndef slow_f(x):\n  # Element-wise ops see a large benefit from fusion\n  return x * x + x * 2.0\n\nx = jnp.ones((5000, 5000))\nfast_f = jit(slow_f)\n%timeit -n10 -r3 fast_f(x)  # ~ 4.5 ms \/ loop on Titan X\n%timeit -n10 -r3 slow_f(x)  # ~ 14.5 ms \/ loop (also on GPU via JAX)\nYou can mix jit and grad and any other JAX transformation however you like.\nUsing jit puts constraints on the kind of Python control flow\nthe function can use; see\nthe Gotchas\nNotebook\nfor more.\nAuto-vectorization with vmap\nvmap is\nthe vectorizing map.\nIt has the familiar semantics of mapping a function along array axes, but\ninstead of keeping the loop on the outside, it pushes the loop down into a\nfunction\u2019s primitive operations for better performance.\nUsing vmap can save you from having to carry around batch dimensions in your\ncode. For example, consider this simple unbatched neural network prediction\nfunction:\ndef predict(params, input_vec):\n  assert input_vec.ndim == 1\n  for W, b in params:\n    output_vec = jnp.dot(W, input_vec) + b  # `input_vec` on the right-hand side!\n    input_vec = jnp.tanh(output_vec)\n  return output_vec\nWe often instead write jnp.dot(inputs, W) to allow for a batch dimension on the\nleft side of inputs, but we\u2019ve written this particular prediction function to\napply only to single input vectors. If we wanted to apply this function to a\nbatch of inputs at once, semantically we could just write\nfrom functools import partial\npredictions = jnp.stack(list(map(partial(predict, params), input_batch)))\nBut pushing one example through the network at a time would be slow! It\u2019s better\nto vectorize the computation, so that at every layer we\u2019re doing matrix-matrix\nmultiplies rather than matrix-vector multiplies.\nThe vmap function does that transformation for us. That is, if we write\nfrom jax import vmap\npredictions = vmap(partial(predict, params))(input_batch)\n# or, alternatively\npredictions = vmap(predict, in_axes=(None, 0))(params, input_batch)\nthen the vmap function will push the outer loop inside the function, and our\nmachine will end up executing matrix-matrix multiplications exactly as if we\u2019d\ndone the batching by hand.\nIt\u2019s easy enough to manually batch a simple neural network without vmap, but\nin other cases manual vectorization can be impractical or impossible. Take the\nproblem of efficiently computing per-example gradients: that is, for a fixed set\nof parameters, we want to compute the gradient of our loss function evaluated\nseparately at each example in a batch. With vmap, it\u2019s easy:\nper_example_gradients = vmap(partial(grad(loss), params))(inputs, targets)\nOf course, vmap can be arbitrarily composed with jit, grad, and any other\nJAX transformation! We use vmap with both forward- and reverse-mode automatic\ndifferentiation for fast Jacobian and Hessian matrix calculations in\njax.jacfwd, jax.jacrev, and jax.hessian.\nSPMD programming with pmap\nFor parallel programming of multiple accelerators, like multiple GPUs, use\npmap.\nWith pmap you write single-program multiple-data (SPMD) programs, including\nfast parallel collective communication operations. Applying pmap will mean\nthat the function you write is compiled by XLA (similarly to jit), then\nreplicated and executed in parallel across devices.\nHere's an example on an 8-GPU machine:\nfrom jax import random, pmap\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\n# Create 8 random 5000 x 6000 matrices, one per GPU\nkeys = random.split(random.PRNGKey(0), 8)\nmats = pmap(lambda key: random.normal(key, (5000, 6000)))(keys)\n\n# Run a local matmul on each device in parallel (no data transfer)\nresult = pmap(lambda x: jnp.dot(x, x.T))(mats)  # result.shape is (8, 5000, 5000)\n\n# Compute the mean on each device in parallel and print the result\nprint(pmap(jnp.mean)(result))\n# prints [1.1566595 1.1805978 ... 1.2321935 1.2015157]\nIn addition to expressing pure maps, you can use fast collective communication\noperations\nbetween devices:\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom jax import lax\n\n@partial(pmap, axis_name='i')\ndef normalize(x):\n  return x \/ lax.psum(x, 'i')\n\nprint(normalize(jnp.arange(4.)))\n# prints [0.         0.16666667 0.33333334 0.5       ]\nYou can even nest pmap functions for more\nsophisticated communication patterns.\nIt all composes, so you're free to differentiate through parallel computations:\nfrom jax import grad\n\n@pmap\ndef f(x):\n  y = jnp.sin(x)\n  @pmap\n  def g(z):\n    return jnp.cos(z) * jnp.tan(y.sum()) * jnp.tanh(x).sum()\n  return grad(lambda w: jnp.sum(g(w)))(x)\n\nprint(f(x))\n# [[ 0.        , -0.7170853 ],\n#  [-3.1085174 , -0.4824318 ],\n#  [10.366636  , 13.135289  ],\n#  [ 0.22163185, -0.52112055]]\n\nprint(grad(lambda x: jnp.sum(f(x)))(x))\n# [[ -3.2369726,  -1.6356447],\n#  [  4.7572474,  11.606951 ],\n#  [-98.524414 ,  42.76499  ],\n#  [ -1.6007166,  -1.2568436]]\nWhen reverse-mode differentiating a pmap function (e.g. with grad), the\nbackward pass of the computation is parallelized just like the forward pass.\nSee the SPMD\nCookbook\nand the SPMD MNIST classifier from scratch\nexample\nfor more.\nCurrent gotchas\nFor a more thorough survey of current gotchas, with examples and explanations,\nwe highly recommend reading the Gotchas\nNotebook.\nSome standouts:\n\nJAX transformations only work on pure functions, which don't have side-effects and respect referential transparency (i.e. object identity testing with is isn't preserved). If you use a JAX transformation on an impure Python function, you might see an error like Exception: Can't lift Traced...  or Exception: Different traces at same level.\nIn-place mutating updates of\narrays, like x[i] += y, aren't supported, but there are functional alternatives. Under a jit, those functional alternatives will reuse buffers in-place automatically.\nRandom numbers are\ndifferent, but for good reasons.\nIf you're looking for convolution\noperators,\nthey're in the jax.lax package.\nJAX enforces single-precision (32-bit, e.g. float32) values by default, and\nto enable\ndouble-precision\n(64-bit, e.g. float64) one needs to set the jax_enable_x64 variable at\nstartup (or set the environment variable JAX_ENABLE_X64=True).\nSome of NumPy's dtype promotion semantics involving a mix of Python scalars\nand NumPy types aren't preserved, namely np.add(1, np.array([2], np.float32)).dtype is float64 rather than float32.\nSome transformations, like jit, constrain how you can use Python control\nflow.\nYou'll always get loud errors if something goes wrong. You might have to use\njit's static_argnums\nparameter,\nstructured control flow\nprimitives\nlike\nlax.scan,\nor just use jit on smaller subfunctions.\n\nInstallation\nJAX is written in pure Python, but it depends on XLA, which needs to be\ninstalled as the jaxlib package. Use the following instructions to install a\nbinary package with pip, or to build JAX from source.\nWe support installing or building jaxlib on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 or later) and\nmacOS (10.12 or later) platforms. Windows users can use JAX on CPU via the\nWindows Subsystem for Linux.\nWe're not currently working on native Windows support, but contributions are\nwelcome (see #438).\npip installation\nTo install a CPU-only version, which might be useful for doing local\ndevelopment on a laptop, you can run\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade jax jaxlib  # CPU-only version\nOn Linux, it is often necessary to first update pip to a version that supports\nmanylinux2010 wheels.\nIf you want to install JAX with both CPU and GPU support, using existing CUDA\nand CUDNN7 installations on your machine (for example, preinstalled on your\ncloud VM), you can run\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade jax jaxlib==0.1.57+cuda110 -f https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/jax-releases\/jax_releases.html\nThe jaxlib version must correspond to the version of the existing CUDA\ninstallation you want to use, with cuda110 for CUDA 11.0, cuda102 for CUDA\n10.2, and cuda101 for CUDA 10.1. You can find your\nCUDA version with: install path:\nnvcc --version\nNote that some GPU functionality expects the CUDA installation to be at\n\/usr\/local\/cuda-X.X, where X.X should be replaced with the CUDA version number\n(e.g. cuda-10.2). If CUDA is installed elsewhere on your system, you can either\ncreate a symlink:\nsudo ln -s \/path\/to\/cuda \/usr\/local\/cuda-X.X\nOr set the following environment variable before importing JAX:\nXLA_FLAGS=--xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=\/path\/to\/cuda\nPlease let us know on the issue tracker\nif you run into any errors or problems with the prebuilt wheels.\nBuilding JAX from source\nSee Building JAX from\nsource.\nNeural network libraries\nMultiple Google research groups develop and share libraries for training neural\nnetworks in JAX. If you want a fully featured library for neural network\ntraining with examples and how-to guides, try\nFlax. Another option is\nTrax, a combinator-based framework focused on\nease-of-use and end-to-end single-command examples, especially for sequence\nmodels and reinforcement learning. Finally,\nObjax is a minimalist object-oriented\nframework with a PyTorch-like interface.\nDeepMind has open-sourced an ecosystem of libraries around JAX including\nHaiku for neural network modules,\nOptax for gradient processing and\noptimization, RLax for RL algorithms, and\nchex for reliable code and testing.\nCiting JAX\nTo cite this repository:\n@software{jax2018github,\n  author = {James Bradbury and Roy Frostig and Peter Hawkins and Matthew James Johnson and Chris Leary and Dougal Maclaurin and Skye Wanderman-Milne},\n  title = {{JAX}: composable transformations of {P}ython+{N}um{P}y programs},\n  url = {http:\/\/github.com\/google\/jax},\n  version = {0.2.5},\n  year = {2018},\n}\n\nIn the above bibtex entry, names are in alphabetical order, the version number\nis intended to be that from jax\/version.py, and\nthe year corresponds to the project's open-source release.\nA nascent version of JAX, supporting only automatic differentiation and\ncompilation to XLA, was described in a paper that appeared at SysML\n2018.

In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual\nassistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously\ndiscussed \u2013 Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.\nThere's a lot more background information in this\nblog post.\n\n\n\nWhat does Rasa do? \ud83e\udd14\nCheck out our Website\n\n\nI'm new to Rasa \ud83d\ude04\nGet Started with Rasa\n\n\nI'd like to read the detailed docs \ud83e\udd13\nRead The Docs\n\n\nI'm ready to install Rasa \ud83d\ude80\nInstallation\n\n\nI want to learn how to use Rasa \ud83d\ude80\nTutorial\n\n\nI have a question \u2753\nRasa Community Forum\n\n\nI would like to contribute \ud83e\udd17\nHow to Contribute\n\n\n\nWhere to get help\nThere is extensive documentation in the Rasa Docs.\nMake sure to select the correct version so you are looking at\nthe docs for the version you installed.\nPlease use Rasa Community Forum for quick answers to\nquestions.\nREADME Contents:\n\nHow to contribute\nDevelopment Internals\nLicense\n\nHow to contribute\nWe are very happy to receive and merge your contributions into this repository!\nTo contribute via pull request, follow these steps:\n\nCreate an issue describing the feature you want to work on (or\nhave a look at the contributor board)\nWrite your code, tests and documentation, and format them with black\nCreate a pull request describing your changes\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to contribute code, check out these code contributor guidelines.\nYou can find more information about how to contribute to Rasa (in lots of\ndifferent ways!) on our website..\nYour pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer, who will get\nback to you about any necessary changes or questions.

If you want to build it from source,\nyou have to install Poetry first. This is how it can be done:\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/python-poetry\/poetry\/master\/get-poetry.py | python\nThere are several other ways to install Poetry. Please, follow\nthe official guide to see all possible options.\nManaging environments\nThe official Poetry guide suggests to use\npyenv or any other similar tool to easily switch between Python versions.\nThis is how it can be done:\npyenv install 3.7.6\npyenv local 3.7.6  # Activate Python 3.7.6 for the current project\nBy default, Poetry will try to use the currently activated Python version to create the virtual environment\nfor the current project automatically. You can also create and activate a virtual environment manually \u2014 in this\ncase, Poetry should pick it up and use it to install the dependencies. For example:\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv\/bin\/activate\nYou can make sure that the environment is picked up by executing\npoetry env info\nBuilding from source\nTo install dependencies and rasa itself in editable mode execute\nmake install\nRunning and changing the documentation\nFirst of all, install all the required dependencies:\nmake install install-docs\nAfter the installation has finished, you can run and view the documentation\nlocally using:\nmake livedocs\nIt should open a new tab with the local version of the docs in your browser;\nif not, visit http:\/\/localhost:3000 in your browser.\nYou can now change the docs locally and the web page will automatically reload\nand apply your changes.\nRunning the Tests\nIn order to run the tests, make sure that you have the development requirements installed:\nmake prepare-tests-ubuntu # Only on Ubuntu and Debian based systems\nmake prepare-tests-macos  # Only on macOS\nThen, run the tests:\nmake test\nThey can also be run at multiple jobs to save some time:\nJOBS=[n] make test\nWhere [n] is the number of jobs desired. If omitted, [n] will be automatically chosen by pytest.\nResolving merge conflicts\nPoetry doesn't include any solution that can help to resolve merge conflicts in\nthe lock file poetry.lock by default.\nHowever, there is a great tool called poetry-merge-lock.\nHere is how you can install it:\npip install poetry-merge-lock\nJust execute this command to resolve merge conflicts in poetry.lock automatically:\npoetry-merge-lock\nSteps to release a new version\nReleasing a new version is quite simple, as the packages are build and distributed by GitHub Actions.\nTerminology:\n\npatch release (third version part increases): 1.1.2 -> 1.1.3\nminor release (second version part increases): 1.1.3 -> 1.2.0\nmajor release (first version part increases): 1.2.0 -> 2.0.0\n\nRelease steps:\n\nMake sure all dependencies are up to date (especially Rasa SDK)\n\nFor Rasa SDK that means first creating a new Rasa SDK release (make sure the version numbers between the new Rasa and Rasa SDK releases match)\nOnce the tag with the new Rasa SDK release is pushed and the package appears on pypi, the dependency in the rasa repository can be resolved (see below).\n\n\nSwitch to the branch you want to cut the release from (master in case of a major \/ minor, the current feature branch for patch releases)\n\nUpdate the rasa-sdk entry in pyproject.toml with the new release version and run poetry update. This creates a new poetry.lock file with all dependencies resolved.\nCommit the changes with git commit -am \"bump rasa-sdk dependency\" but do not push them. They will be automatically picked up by the following step.\n\n\nRun make release\nCreate a PR against master or the release branch (e.g. 1.2.x)\nOnce your PR is merged, tag a new release (this SHOULD always happen on master or release branches), e.g. using\ngit tag 1.2.0 -m \"next release\"\ngit push origin 1.2.0\nGitHub will build this tag and push a package to pypi\nIf this is a minor release, a new release branch should be created pointing to the same commit as the tag to allow for future patch releases, e.g.\ngit checkout -b 1.2.x\ngit push origin 1.2.x\n\n\nCode Style\nTo ensure a standardized code style we use the formatter black.\nTo ensure our type annotations are correct we use the type checker pytype.\nIf your code is not formatted properly or doesn't type check, GitHub will fail to build.\nFormatting\nIf you want to automatically format your code on every commit, you can use pre-commit.\nJust install it via pip install pre-commit and execute pre-commit install in the root folder.\nThis will add a hook to the repository, which reformats files on every commit.\nIf you want to set it up manually, install black via poetry install.\nTo reformat files execute\nmake formatter\n\nType Checking\nIf you want to check types on the codebase, install mypy using poetry install.\nTo check the types execute\nmake types\n\nDeploying documentation updates\nWe use Docusaurus v2 to build docs for tagged versions and for the master branch.\nThe static site that gets built is pushed to the documentation branch of this repo.\nWe host the site on netlify. On master branch builds (see .github\/workflows\/documentation.yml), we push the built docs to\nthe documentation branch. Netlify automatically re-deploys the docs pages whenever there is a change to that branch.\nLicense\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\nCopyright 2020 Rasa Technologies GmbH.

engine clone of the Genie Engine used by Age of Empires, Age of Empires II (HD) and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, comparable to projects like OpenMW, OpenRA,  OpenSAGE, OpenTTD and OpenRCT2. At the moment we focus our efforts on the integration of Age of Empires II, while being primarily aimed at POSIX platforms such as GNU\/Linux.\nopenage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but (for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them.\nTo play, you require an original AoE II: TC or AoE II: HD installation\n(via Wine or Steam-Linux).\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\nContact\nWhere?\n\n\n\n\nIssue Tracker\nSFTtech\/openage\n\n\nDevelopment Blog\nblog.openage.dev\n\n\nForum\n \/r\/openage\n\n\nMatrix Chat\n#sfttech:matrix.org\n\n\nIRC Chat\nirc.freenode.net #sfttech\n\n\nMoney Sink\n\n\n\n\nTechnical foundation\n\n\n\nTechnology\nComponent\n\n\n\n\nC++17\nEngine core\n\n\nPython3\nScripting, media conversion, in-game console, code generation\n\n\nQt5\nGraphical user interface\n\n\nCython\nGlue code\n\n\nCMake\nBuild system\n\n\nOpenGL3.3\nRendering, shaders\n\n\nSDL2\nCross-platform Audio\/Input\/Window handling\n\n\nOpus\nAudio codec\n\n\nnyan\nContent Configuration and Modding\n\n\nHumans\nMixing together all of the above\n\n\n\nGoals\n\nFully authentic look and feel\n\nThis can only be approximated, since the behaviour of the original game is mostly undocumented,\nand guessing\/experimenting can only get you this close\nWe will not implement useless artificial limitations (max 30 selectable units...)\n\n\nAn easily-moddable content format: nyan yet another notation\nAn integrated Python console and API, comparable to blender\nAI scripting in Python, you can use machine learning\n\nhere is some additional literature\n\n\nRe-creating free game assets\nMultiplayer (obviously)\nMatchmaking and ranking with a haskell masterserver\nOptionally, improvements over the original game\nAwesome infrastructure such as our own Kevin CI service\n\nBut beware, for sanity reasons:\n\nNo network compatibility with the original game.\nYou really wanna have the same problems again?\nNo binary compatibility with the original game.\nA one-way script to convert maps\/savegames\/missions to openage is planned though.\n\nCurrent State of the Project\nImportant notice: Gameplay is currently non-functional as the internal simulation is replaced by a more sophisticated implementation. You also might experience errors when running a build. Gameplay will return in a later update. Detailed explanations can be found in this blog post.\n\n\nWhat features are currently implemented?\n\nSee status page.\n\n\n\nWhat's the plan?\n\nSee doc\/milestones.md.

Written mostly in Python 3. There are a lot of TODOs and beginner issues available\nright now, so it's a good place to get your feet wet.\nGame simulation: Also known as the gameplay implementation. Written in C++, using the\nEntity-Component-System paradigm in addition to an event-driven simulation.\nDocumentation: We not only document code, but also anything technical about the Genie engine\nand its games. If you like documenting file formats\nor thouroughly investigating game mechanics,\nthen this might be the right place to start.\n\n\nCheck the issues labelled with good first issues. These are tasks that you can start right away\nand don't require much previous knowledge.\nAsk us in the chat. Someone there could need\nhelp with something.\nYou can also take the initiative and fix a bug you found, create an issue for discussion or\nimplement a feature that we never though of, but always wanted.\n\nOk, I found something. What now?\n\nTell us, if you haven't already. Chances are that we have additional information\nand directions.\nRead the docs. They will answer most \"administrative\"\nquestions like what code style is used and how the engine core parts are connected.\nRead the code and get familiar with the engine component you want to work with.\nDo not hesitate to ask us for help if you do not understand something.\n\nHow do I contribute my features\/changes?\n\nRead the contributing guide.\nYou can upload work in progress (WIP) revisions or drafts of your contribution to get feedback or support.\nTell us (again) when you want us to review your work.\n\nI want to help, but I'm not a programmer...\nThen openage might be a good reason to become one! We have many issues and tasks for beginners. You\njust have to ask and we'll find something. Alternatively, lurking is also allowed.\n\nCheers, happy hecking.\nDevelopment Process\nWhat does openage development look like in practice?\n\nextensive synchronization!\ndoc\/development.md.\n\nHow can I help?\n\ndoc\/contributing.md.\n\nAll documentation is also in this repo:\n\nCode documentation is embedded in the sources for Doxygen (see doc readme).\nHave a look at the doc directory. This folder tends to get outdated when code changes.\n\nLicense\nGNU GPLv3 or later; see copying.md and legal\/GPLv3.\nI know that probably nobody is ever gonna look at the copying.md file,\nbut if you want to contribute code to openage, please take the time to\nskim through it and add yourself to the authors list.\n","204":"Pelican  \n \n\nPelican is a static site generator, written in Python.\n\nWrite content in reStructuredText or Markdown using your editor of choice\nIncludes a simple command line tool to (re)generate site files\nEasy to interface with version control systems and web hooks\nCompletely static output is simple to host anywhere\n\n\nFeatures\nPelican currently supports:\n\nChronological content (e.g., articles, blog posts) as well as static pages\nIntegration with external services (e.g., Google Analytics and Disqus)\nSite themes (created using Jinja2 templates)\nPublication of articles in multiple languages\nGeneration of Atom and RSS feeds\nSyntax highlighting via Pygments\nImporting existing content from WordPress, Dotclear, and other services\nFast rebuild times due to content caching and selective output writing\n\nCheck out Pelican's documentation for further information.\n\nHow to get help, contribute, or provide feedback\nSee our contribution submission and feedback guidelines.\n\nSource code\nPelican's source code is hosted on GitHub.

is a set of Ansible playbooks that you can use to build and maintain your own personal cloud based entirely on open source software, so you\u2019re in control.\nIf you\u2019ve never used Ansible before, you might find these playbooks useful to learn from, since they show off a fair bit of what the tool can do.\nThe original author's background and motivations might be of interest. tl;dr: frustrations with Google Apps and concerns about privacy and long-term support.\nSovereign offers useful cloud services while being reasonably secure and low-maintenance. Use it to set up your server, SSH in every couple weeks, but mostly forget about it.\nServices Provided\nWhat do you get if you point Sovereign at a server? All kinds of good stuff!\n\nIMAP over SSL via Dovecot, complete with full text search provided by Solr.\nPOP3 over SSL, also via Dovecot\nSMTP over SSL via Postfix, including a nice set of DNSBLs to discard spam before it ever hits your filters.\nVirtual domains for your email, backed by PostgreSQL.\nSpam fighting via Rspamd.\nMail server verification using DKIM and DMARC so the Internet knows your mailserver is legit.\nSecure on-disk storage for email and more via EncFS.\nWebmail via Roundcube.\nMobile push notifications via Z-Push.\nEmail client automatic configuration.\nJabber\/XMPP instant messaging via Prosody.\nAn RSS Reader via Selfoss.\nCalDAV and CardDAV to keep your calendars and contacts in sync, via ownCloud.\nYour own private storage cloud via ownCloud.\nYour own VPN server via OpenVPN.\nAn IRC bouncer via ZNC.\nMonit to keep everything running smoothly (and alert you when it\u2019s not).\ncollectd to collect system statistics.\nWeb hosting (ex: for your blog) via Apache.\nFirewall management via Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw).\nIntrusion prevention via fail2ban and rootkit detection via rkhunter.\nSSH configuration preventing root login and insecure password authentication\nRFC6238 two-factor authentication compatible with Google Authenticator and various hardware tokens\nNightly backups to Tarsnap.\nGit hosting via cgit and gitolite.\nRead-it-later via Wallabag\nA bunch of nice-to-have tools like mosh and htop that make life with a server a little easier.\n\nDon\u2019t want one or more of the above services? Comment out the relevant role in site.yml. Or get more granular and comment out the associated include: directive in one of the playbooks.\nUsage\nWhat You\u2019ll Need\n\nA VPS (or bare-metal server if you wanna ball hard). My VPS is hosted at Linode. You\u2019ll probably want at least 512 MB of RAM between Apache, Solr, and PostgreSQL. Mine has 1024.\n64-bit Debian 8.3 or an equivalent Linux distribution. (You can use whatever distro you want, but deviating from Debian will require more tweaks to the playbooks. See Ansible\u2019s different packaging modules.)\nA Tarsnap account with some credit in it. You could comment this out if you want to use a different backup service. Consider paying your hosting provider for backups or using an additional backup service for redundancy.\n\nYou do not need to acquire an SSL certificate.  The SSL certificates you need will be obtained from Let's Encrypt automatically when you deploy your server.\nInstallation\nOn the remote server\nThe following steps are done on the remote server by sshing into it and running these commands.\n1. Install required packages e.g aptitude is required on Debian\napt-get install sudo python\n\n2. Get a Tarsnap machine key\nIf you haven\u2019t already, download and install Tarsnap, or use brew install tarsnap if you use Homebrew.\nCreate a new machine key for your server:\ntarsnap-keygen --keyfile roles\/tarsnap\/files\/decrypted_tarsnap.key --user me@example.com --machine example.com\n\nDownload a copy of this key and keep it somewhere safe!  There's no point having backups if you can't retrieve them when needed.\n3. Prep the server\nFor goodness sake, change the root password:\npasswd\n\nCreate a user account for Ansible to do its thing through:\nuseradd deploy\npasswd deploy\nmkdir \/home\/deploy\n\nAuthorize your ssh key if you want passwordless ssh login (optional):\nmkdir \/home\/deploy\/.ssh\nchmod 700 \/home\/deploy\/.ssh\nnano \/home\/deploy\/.ssh\/authorized_keys\nchmod 400 \/home\/deploy\/.ssh\/authorized_keys\nchown deploy:deploy \/home\/deploy -R\necho 'deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' > \/etc\/sudoers.d\/deploy\n\nYour new account will be automatically set up for passwordless sudo. Or you can just add your deploy user to the sudo group.\nadduser deploy sudo\n\nOn your local machine\nAnsible (the tool setting up your server) runs locally on your computer and sends commands to the remote server. Download this repository somewhere on your machine, either through Clone or Download > Download ZIP above, wget, or git as below\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/sovereign\/sovereign.git\n\n4. Configure your installation\nModify the settings in the group_vars\/sovereign folder to your liking. If you want to see how they\u2019re used in context, just search for the corresponding string.\nAll of the variables in group_vars\/sovereign must be set for sovereign to function.\nFor Git hosting, copy your public key into place:\ncp ~\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub roles\/git\/files\/gitolite.pub\n\nFinally, replace the host.example.net in the file hosts. If your SSH daemon listens on a non-standard port, add a colon and the port number after the IP address. In that case you also need to add your custom port to the task Set firewall rules for web traffic and SSH in the file roles\/common\/tasks\/ufw.yml.\n5. Set up DNS\nIf you\u2019ve just bought a new domain name, point it at Linode\u2019s DNS Manager or similar. Most VPS services (and even some domain registrars) offer a managed DNS service that you can use for this at no charge. If you\u2019re using an existing domain that\u2019s already managed elsewhere, you can probably just modify a few records.\nCreate A or CNAME records which point to your server's IP address:\n\nexample.com\nmail.example.com\nwww.example.com (for Web hosting)\nautoconfig.example.com (for email client automatic configuration)\nread.example.com (for Wallabag)\nnews.example.com (for Selfoss)\ncloud.example.com (for ownCloud)\ngit.example.com (for cgit)\n\n6. Run the Ansible Playbooks\nFirst, make sure you\u2019ve got Ansible 1.9.3+ installed.\nTo run the whole dang thing:\nansible-playbook -i .\/hosts --ask-sudo-pass site.yml\n\nIf you chose to make a passwordless sudo deploy user, you can omit the --ask-sudo-pass argument.\nTo run just one or more piece, use tags. I try to tag all my includes for easy isolated development. For example, to focus in on your firewall setup:\nansible-playbook -i .\/hosts --tags=ufw site.yml\n\nYou might find that it fails at one point or another. This is probably because something needs to be done manually, usually because there\u2019s no good way of automating it. Fortunately, all the tasks are clearly named so you should be able to find out where it stopped. I\u2019ve tried to add comments where manual intervention is necessary.\nThe dependencies tag just installs dependencies, performing no other operations. The tasks associated with the dependencies tag do not rely on the user-provided settings that live in group_vars\/sovereign. Running the playbook with the dependencies tag is particularly convenient for working with Docker images.\n7. Finish DNS set-up\nCreate an MX record for example.com which assigns mail.example.com as the domain\u2019s mail server.\nTo ensure your emails pass DKIM checks you need to add a txt record. The name field will be default._domainkey.EXAMPLE.COM. The value field contains the public key used by DKIM. The exact value needed can be found in the file \/var\/lib\/rspamd\/dkim\/EXAMPLE.COM.default.txt. It will look something like this:\nv=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDKKAQfMwKVx+oJripQI+Ag4uTwYnsXKjgBGtl7Tk6UMTUwhMqnitqbR\/ZQEZjcNolTkNDtyKZY2Z6LqvM4KsrITpiMbkV1eX6GKczT8Lws5KXn+6BHCKULGdireTAUr3Id7mtjLrbi\/E3248Pq0Zs39hkDxsDcve12WccjafJVwIDAQAB\n\nFor DMARC you'll also need to add a txt record. The name field should be _dmarc.EXAMPLE.COM and the value should be v=DMARC1; p=none. More info on DMARC can be found here.\nSet up SPF and reverse DNS as per this post. Make sure to validate that it\u2019s all working, for example, by sending an email to check-auth@verifier.port25.com and reviewing the report that will be emailed back to you.\n8. Miscellaneous Configuration\nSign in to the ZNC web interface and set things up to your liking. It isn\u2019t exposed through the firewall, so you must first set up an SSH tunnel:\nssh deploy@example.com -L 6643:localhost:6643\n\nThen proceed to http:\/\/localhost:6643 in your web browser.\nSimilarly, to access the server monitoring page, use another SSH tunnel:\nssh deploy@example.com -L 2812:localhost:2812\n\nAgain proceeding to http:\/\/localhost:2812 in your web browser.\nFinally, sign into ownCloud with a new administrator account to set it\nup. You should select PostgreSQL as the configuration backend. Use\nowncloud as the database user and the database name. For the\ndatabase password ansible has created a set of random passwords for\neach service and stores them in your local folder secret, use the\none in the file owncloud_db_password.\nHow To Use Your New Personal Cloud\nWe\u2019re collecting known-good client setups on our wiki.\nTroubleshooting\nIf you run into an errors, please check the wiki page. If the problem you encountered, is not listed, please go ahead and create an issue. If you already have a bugfix and\/or workaround, just put them in the issue and the wiki page.\nReboots\nYou will need to manually enter the password for any encrypted volumes on reboot. This is not Sovereign-specific, but rather a function of how EncFS works. This will necessitate SSHing into your machine after reboot, or accessing it via a console interface if one is available to you. Once you're in, run this:\nencfs \/encrypted \/decrypted --public\n\nIt is possible that some daemons may need to be restarted after you enter your password for the encrypted volume(s). Some services may stall out while looking for resources that will only be available once the \/decrypted volume is available and visible to daemon user accounts.\nIRC\nAsk questions and provide feedback in #sovereign on Freenode.\n","208":"Note\nThis README.md documents the process of creating a Virtual Hackintosh\nsystem.\nNote: All blobs and resources included in this repository are re-derivable (all\ninstructions are included!).\n\ud83d\udc9a Looking for commercial support with this stuff?

Such a system can be used\nfor a variety of purposes (e.g. software builds, testing, reversing work), and\nit may be all you need, along with some tweaks documented in this repository.\nHowever, such a system lacks graphical acceleration, a reliable sound sub-system,\nUSB (3) functionality and other similar things. To enable these things, take a\nlook at our notes. We would like to resume our testing and\ndocumentation work around this area. Please reach out to us\nif you are able to fund this area of work.\nIt is possible to have 'beyond-native-apple-hw' performance but it does require\nwork, patience, and a bit of luck (perhaps?).\nPost-Installation\n\n\nSee networking notes to setup guest networking.\nI have the following commands present in \/etc\/rc.local.\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\n\nsudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap\nsudo ip link set tap0 up promisc on\nsudo ip link set dev virbr0 up\nsudo ip link set dev tap0 master virbr0\n\nThis has been enough for me so far.\nNote: You may need to enable the rc.local functionality manually on modern Ubuntu versions.\n\n\nTo get sound on your virtual Mac, see the \"Virtual Sound Device\" in notes.\n\n\nTo passthrough GPUs and other devices, see these notes.\n\n\nNeed a different resolution?

It is also included in a public court document available here. I am not a lawyer but it seems that Apple's attempt(s) to get the OSK string treated as a trade secret did not work out. Due to these reasons, the OSK string is freely included in this repository.\nPlease review the 'Legality of Hackintoshing' documentation bits from Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide.\nGabriel Somlo also has some thoughts on the legal aspects involved in running macOS under QEMU\/KVM.\nMotivation\nMy aim is to enable macOS based educational tasks, builds + testing, kernel\ndebugging, reversing, and macOS security research in an easy, reproducible\nmanner without getting 'invested' in Apple's closed ecosystem (too heavily).\nThese Virtual Hackintosh systems are not intended to replace the genuine\nphysical macOS systems.\nPersonally speaking, this repository has been a way for me to 'exit' the Apple\necosystem. It has helped me to test and compare the interoperability of Canon CanoScan LiDE 120 scanner, and Brother HL-2250DN laser printer.

simple framework for state-of-the-art NLP. Developed by Humboldt University of Berlin and friends.\n\nIMPORTANT: (30.08.2020) We moved our models to a new server. Please update your Flair to the newest version!\n\n\nFlair is:\n\n\nA powerful NLP library. Flair allows you to apply our state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)\nmodels to your text, such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (PoS),\nsense disambiguation and classification, with support for a rapidly growing number of languages.\n\n\nA biomedical NER library. Flair has special support for biomedical data with\nstate-of-the-art models for biomedical NER and support for over 32 biomedical datasets.\n\n\nA text embedding library. Flair has simple interfaces that allow you to use and combine different word and\ndocument embeddings, including our proposed Flair embeddings, BERT embeddings and ELMo embeddings.\n\n\nA PyTorch NLP framework. Our framework builds directly on PyTorch, making it easy to\ntrain your own models and experiment with new approaches using Flair embeddings and classes.\n\n\nNow at version 0.6.1!\nComparison with State-of-the-Art\nFlair outperforms the previous best methods on a range of NLP tasks:\n\n\n\nTask\nLanguage\nDataset\nFlair\nPrevious best\n\n\n\n\nNamed Entity Recognition\nEnglish\nConll-03\n93.18 (F1)\n92.22 (Peters et al., 2018)\n\n\nNamed Entity Recognition\nEnglish\nOntonotes\n89.3 (F1)\n86.28 (Chiu et al., 2016)\n\n\nEmerging Entity Detection\nEnglish\nWNUT-17\n49.49 (F1)\n45.55 (Aguilar et al., 2018)\n\n\nPart-of-Speech tagging\nEnglish\nWSJ\n97.85\n97.64 (Choi, 2016)\n\n\nChunking\nEnglish\nConll-2000\n96.72 (F1)\n96.36 (Peters et al., 2017)\n\n\nNamed Entity Recognition\nGerman\nConll-03\n88.27 (F1)\n78.76 (Lample et al., 2016)\n\n\nNamed Entity Recognition\nGerman\nGermeval\n84.65 (F1)\n79.08 (H\u00e4nig et al, 2014)\n\n\nNamed Entity Recognition\nDutch\nConll-02\n92.38 (F1)\n81.74 (Lample et al., 2016)\n\n\nNamed Entity Recognition\nPolish\nPolEval-2018\n86.6 (F1)  (Borchmann et al., 2018)\n85.1 (PolDeepNer)\n\n\n\nHere's how to reproduce these numbers using Flair. You can also find detailed evaluations and discussions in our papers:\n\n\nContextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling.\nAlan Akbik, Duncan Blythe and Roland Vollgraf.\n27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING 2018.\n\n\nPooled Contextualized Embeddings for Named Entity Recognition.\nAlan Akbik, Tanja Bergmann and Roland Vollgraf.\n2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, NAACL 2019.\n\n\nFLAIR: An Easy-to-Use Framework for State-of-the-Art NLP.\nAlan Akbik, Tanja Bergmann, Duncan Blythe, Kashif Rasul, Stefan Schweter and Roland Vollgraf.\n2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Demonstrations), NAACL 2019.\n\n\nQuick Start\nRequirements and Installation\nThe project is based on PyTorch 1.1+ and Python 3.6+, because method signatures and type hints are beautiful.\nIf you do not have Python 3.6, install it first. Here is how for Ubuntu 16.04.\nThen, in your favorite virtual environment, simply do:\npip install flair\n\nExample Usage\nLet's run named entity recognition (NER) over an example sentence. All you need to do is make a Sentence, load\na pre-trained model and use it to predict tags for the sentence:\nfrom flair.data import Sentence\nfrom flair.models import SequenceTagger\n\n# make a sentence\nsentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')\n\n# load the NER tagger\ntagger = SequenceTagger.load('ner')\n\n# run NER over sentence\ntagger.predict(sentence)\nDone! The Sentence now has entity annotations. Print the sentence to see what the tagger found.\nprint(sentence)\nprint('The following NER tags are found:')\n\n# iterate over entities and print\nfor entity in sentence.get_spans('ner'):\n    print(entity)\nThis should print:\nSentence: \"I love Berlin .\" - 4 Tokens\n\nThe following NER tags are found:\n\nSpan [3]: \"Berlin\"   [\u2212 Labels: LOC (0.9992)]\nTutorials\nWe provide a set of quick tutorials to get you started with the library:\n\nTutorial 1: Basics\nTutorial 2: Tagging your Text\nTutorial 3: Embedding Words\nTutorial 4: List of All Word Embeddings\nTutorial 5: Embedding Documents\nTutorial 6: Loading a Dataset\nTutorial 7: Training a Model\nTutorial 8: Training your own Flair Embeddings\nTutorial 9: Training a Zero Shot Text Classifier (TARS)\n\nThe tutorials explain how the base NLP classes work, how you can load pre-trained models to tag your\ntext, how you can embed your text with different word or document embeddings, and how you can train your own\nlanguage models, sequence labeling models, and text classification models. Let us know if anything is unclear.\nThere is also a dedicated landing page for our biomedical NER and datasets with\ninstallation instructions and tutorials.\nThere are also good third-party articles and posts that illustrate how to use Flair:\n\nHow to build a text classifier with Flair\nHow to build a microservice with Flair and Flask\nA docker image for Flair\nGreat overview of Flair functionality and how to use in Colab\nVisualisation tool for highlighting the extracted entities\nPractical approach of State-of-the-Art Flair in Named Entity Recognition\nBenchmarking NER algorithms\nTraining a Flair text classifier on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and serving predictions on GCP\n\nCiting Flair\nPlease cite the following paper when using Flair:\n@inproceedings{akbik2018coling,\n  title={Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling},\n  author={Akbik, Alan and Blythe, Duncan and Vollgraf, Roland},\n  booktitle = {{COLING} 2018, 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics},\n  pages     = {1638--1649},\n  year      = {2018}\n}\n\nIf you use the pooled version of the Flair embeddings (PooledFlairEmbeddings), please cite:\n@inproceedings{akbik2019naacl,\n  title={Pooled Contextualized Embeddings for Named Entity Recognition},\n  author={Akbik, Alan and Bergmann, Tanja and Vollgraf, Roland},\n  booktitle = {{NAACL} 2019, 2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics},\n  pages     = {724\u2013728},\n  year      = {2019}\n}\n\nContact\nPlease email your questions or comments to Alan Akbik.\nContributing\nThanks for your interest in contributing! There are many ways to get involved;\nstart with our contributor guidelines and then\ncheck these open issues for specific tasks.\nFor contributors looking to get deeper into the API we suggest cloning the repository and checking out the unit\ntests for examples of how to call methods. Nearly all classes and methods are documented, so finding your way around\nthe code should hopefully be easy.\nRunning unit tests locally\nYou need Pipenv for this:\npipenv install --dev && pipenv shell\npytest tests\/\nTo run integration tests execute:\npytest --runintegration tests\/\nThe integration tests will train small models.\nAfterwards, the trained model will be loaded for prediction.\nTo also run slow tests, such as loading and using the embeddings provided by flair, you should execute:\npytest --runslow tests\/\nLicense\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nFlair is licensed under the following MIT license: The MIT License (MIT) Copyright \u00a9 2018 Zalando SE, https:\/\/tech.zalando.com\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u201cSoftware\u201d), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You can even style videos!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes 100ms on a 2015 Titan X to style the MIT Stata Center (1024\u00d7680) like Udnie, by Francis Picabia.\n\nOur implementation is based off of a combination of Gatys' A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Johnson's Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution, and Ulyanov's Instance Normalization.\nSponsorship\nPlease consider sponsoring my work on this project!\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2016 Logan Engstrom.

Free for research use, as long as proper attribution is given and this copyright notice is retained.\nVideo Stylization\nHere we transformed every frame in a video, then combined the results. Click to go to the full demo on YouTube! The style here is Udnie, as above.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how to generate these videos here!\nImage Stylization\nWe added styles from various paintings to a photo of Chicago. Click on thumbnails to see full applied style images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation Details\nOur implementation uses TensorFlow to train a fast style transfer network. We use roughly the same transformation network as described in Johnson, except that batch normalization is replaced with Ulyanov's instance normalization, and the scaling\/offset of the output tanh layer is slightly different. We use a loss function close to the one described in Gatys, using VGG19 instead of VGG16 and typically using \"shallower\" layers than in Johnson's implementation (e.g. we use relu1_1 rather than relu1_2). Empirically, this results in larger scale style features in transformations.\nVitual Environment Setup (Anaconda) - Windows\/Linux\nTested on\n\n\n\nSpec\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating System\nWindows 10 Home\n\n\nGPU\nNvidia GTX 2080 TI\n\n\nCUDA Version\n11.0\n\n\nDriver Version\n445.75\n\n\n\nStep 1\uff1aInstall Anaconda\nhttps:\/\/docs.anaconda.com\/anaconda\/install\/\nStep 2\uff1aBuild a virtual environment\nRun the following commands in sequence in Anaconda Prompt:\nconda create -n tf-gpu tensorflow-gpu=2.1.0\nconda activate tf-gpu\nconda install jupyterlab\njupyter lab\n\nRun the following command in the notebook or just conda install the package:\n!pip install moviepy==1.0.2\n\nFollow the commands below to use fast-style-transfer\nDocumentation\nTraining Style Transfer Networks\nUse style.py to train a new style transfer network.

This project is an implementation of Semantic Style Transfer (Champandard, 2016), based on the Neural Patches algorithm (Li, 2016). Read more about the motivation in this in-depth article and watch this workflow video for inspiration.\nThe doodle.py script generates a new image by using one, two, three or four images as inputs depending what you're trying to do: the original style and its annotation, and a target content image (optional) with its annotation (a.k.a. your doodle). The algorithm extracts annotated patches from the style image, and incrementally transfers them over to the target image based on how closely they match.\nNOTE: Making a #NeuralDoodle is a skill. The parameters in the script were adjusted to work well by default and with the examples below. For new images, you may need to adjust values and modify on your input data too. It takes practice, but you can reach almost photo-realistic results if you iterate! (Ask for advice here or see examples.)\n\nExamples & Usage\nInstallation\nTroubleshooting\nFrequent Questions\n\nIMPORTANT: This project is possible thanks to the nucl.ai Conference on Creative AI, July 18-20. Join us in Vienna!\n\n \n \n\n\n\n1. Examples & Usage\nThe main script is called doodle.py, which you can run with Python 3.4+ (see setup below).  The --device argument that lets you specify which GPU or CPU to use. For the samples above, here are the performance results:\n\nGPU Rendering \u2014 Assuming you have CUDA setup and enough on-board RAM, the process should complete in 3 to 8 minutes, even with twice the iteration count.\nCPU Rendering \u2014 This will take hours and hours, even up to 12h on older hardware. To match quality it'd take twice the time. Do multiple runs in parallel!\n\nThe default is to use cpu, if you have NVIDIA card setup with CUDA already try gpu0. On the CPU, you can also set environment variable to OMP_NUM_THREADS=4, but we've found the speed improvements to be minimal.\n\n1.a) Image Analogy\nThe algorithm is built for style transfer, but can also generate image analogies that we call a #NeuralDoodle; use the hashtag if you post your images!  Example files are included in the #\/samples\/ folder. Execute with these commands:\n# Synthesize a coastline as if painted by Monet. This uses \"*_sem.png\" masks for both images.\npython3 doodle.py --style samples\/Monet.jpg --output samples\/Coastline.png \\\n                  --device=cpu --iterations=40\n\n# Generate a scene around a lake in the style of a Renoir painting.\npython3 doodle.py --style samples\/Renoir.jpg --output samples\/Landscape.png \\\n                  --device=gpu0 --iterations=80\nNotice the Renoir results look a little better than the Monet. Some rotational variations of the source image could improve the quality of the arch outline in particular.\n\n1.b) Style Transfer\nIf you want to transfer the style given a source style with annotations, and a target content image with annotations, you can use the following command lines.  In all cases, the semantic map is loaded and used if it's found under the *_sem.png filename that matches the input file.\n# Synthesize a portrait of Seth Johnson like a Gogh portrait. This uses \"*_sem.png\" masks for both images.\npython3 doodle.py --style samples\/Gogh.jpg --content samples\/Seth.png \\\n                  --output SethAsGogh.png --device=cpu --phases=4 --iterations=40\n\n# Generate what a photo of Vincent van Gogh would look like, using Seth's portrait as reference.\npython3 doodle.py --style samples\/Seth.jpg --content samples\/Gogh.png \\\n                  --output GoghAsSeth.png --device=gpu0 --phases=4 --iterations=80\nTo perform regular style transfer without semantic annotations, simply delete or rename the files with the semantic maps.  The photo is originally by Seth Johnson, and the concept for this style transfer by Kyle McDonald.\n\n\n1.c) Texture Synthesis\nFor synthesizing bitmap textures, you only need an input style without anotations and without target output.  In this case, you simply specify one input style image and the output file as follows:\n# First synthesis uses a darker noise pattern as seed.\npython3 doodle.py --style samples\/Wall.jpg --output Wall.png\\\n                  --seed=noise --seed-range=0:128 --iterations=50 --phases=3\n\n# Second synthesis uses a lighter noise pattern as seed.\npython3 doodle.py --style samples\/Wall.jpg --output Wall.png\\\n                  --seed=noise --seed-range=192:255 --iterations=50 --phases=3\nYou can also control the output resolution using --output-size=512x512 parameter\u2014which also depends on the memory you have available. By default the size will be the same as the style image.\n\n\n1.d) Script Parameters\nYou can configure the algorithm using the following parameters. Type python3 doodle.py --help for the full list of options, or see the source code.\n\n--style-weight=50.0 \u2014 Weight of style relative to content.\n--style-layers=3_1,4_1 \u2014 The layers to match style patches.\n--semantic-weight=1.0 \u2014 Global weight of semantics vs. features.\n--smoothness=1.0 \u2014 Weight of image smoothing scheme.\n--seed=noise \u2014 Seed image path, \"noise\" or \"content\".\n--print-every=10 \u2014 How often to log statistics to stdout.\n--save-every=10 \u2014 How frequently to save PNG into frames.\n\n\n2. Installation & Setup\n\n\n2.a) Using Docker Image (recommended)\nThe easiest way to get up-and-running is to install Docker. Then, you should be able to downloand and run the pre-built image using the docker command line tool.  Find out more about the alexjc\/neural-doodle image on its Docker Hub page.\nThe easiest way to run the script from the docker image is to setup an easy access command called doodle. This will automatically:\n\nMount the frames folder from current directory into the instance for visualization.\nExpose the samples folder from the current directory so the script can access files!\n\nThis is how you can do it in your terminal console on OSX or Linux:\n# Setup the alias. Put this in your .bash_rc or .zshrc file so it's available at startup.\nalias doodle=\"docker run -v $(pwd)\/samples:\/nd\/samples -v $(pwd)\/frames:\/nd\/frames \\\n                         -it alexjc\/neural-doodle\"\n\n# Now run any of the examples above using this alias, without the `.py` extension.\ndoodle --help\nIf you want to run on your NVIDIA GPU, you can instead use the image alexjc\/neural-doodle:gpu which comes with CUDA and CUDNN pre-installed in the image.  See the scripts in docker\/*.sh for how to setup your host machine. (advanced)\n\n2.b) Manual Installation (optional)\nThis project requires Python 3.4+ and you'll also need numpy and scipy (numerical computing libraries) as well as python3-dev installed system-wide.  If you want more detailed instructions, follow these:\n\nLinux Installation of Lasagne (intermediate)\nMac OSX Installation of Lasagne (advanced)\nWindows Installation of Lasagne (expert)\n\nAfterward fetching the repository, you can run the following commands from your terminal to setup a local environment:\n# Create a local environment for Python 3.x to install dependencies here.\npython3 -m venv pyvenv --system-site-packages\n\n# If you're using bash, make this the active version of Python.\nsource pyvenv\/bin\/activate\n\n# Setup the required dependencies simply using the PIP module.\npython3 -m pip install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt\nAfter this, you should have scikit-image, theano and lasagne installed in your virtual environment.  You'll also need to download this pre-trained neural network (VGG19, 80Mb) and put it in the same folder as the script to run. Once you're done you can just delete the #\/pyvenv\/ folder.\n\n\n3. Troubleshooting Problems\n\nIt's running out of GPU Ram, throwing MemoryError. Help!\nYou'll need a good NVIDIA card with CUDA to run this software on GPU, ideally 2Gb \/ 4Gb or better still, 8Gb to 12Gb for larger resolutions.  The code does work on CPU by default, so use that as fallback since you likely have more system RAM!\nTo improve memory consumption, you can also install NVIDIA's cudnn library version 3.0 or 4.0. This allows convolutional neural networks to run faster and save space in GPU RAM.\nFIX: Use --device=cpu to use main system memory.\n\nHow much GPU is being used?

Join us on Gitter!\nWe don't have a mailing list; but we are always happy to answer\nquestions on gitter chat.  If you are\nsure you've found a bug please search our issue trackers for a\nduplicate before filing a new issue:\n\nmypy tracker\nfor mypy issues\ntypeshed tracker\nfor issues with specific modules\ntyping tracker\nfor discussion of new type system features (PEP 484 changes) and\nruntime bugs in the typing module\n\nWhat is mypy?\nMypy is an optional static type checker for Python.  You can add type\nhints (PEP 484) to your\nPython programs, and use mypy to type check them statically.\nFind bugs in your programs without even running them!\nYou can mix dynamic and static typing in your programs. You can always\nfall back to dynamic typing when static typing is not convenient, such\nas for legacy code.\nHere is a small example to whet your appetite (Python 3):\nfrom typing import Iterator\n\ndef fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while a < n:\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\nSee the documentation for more examples.\nFor Python 2.7, the standard annotations are written as comments:\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    # type: (str) -> bool\n    return s == s[::-1]\nSee the documentation for Python 2 support.\nMypy is in development; some features are missing and there are bugs.\nSee 'Development status' below.\nRequirements\nYou need Python 3.5 or later to run mypy.  You can have multiple Python\nversions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.\nIn Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:\n$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip\n\nFor other Linux flavors, macOS and Windows, packages are available at\nhttps:\/\/www.python.org\/getit\/\nQuick start\nMypy can be installed using pip:\n$ python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n\nIf you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install from git:\n$ python3 -m pip install -U git+git:\/\/github.com\/python\/mypy.git\n\nNow, if Python on your system is configured properly (else see\n\"Troubleshooting\" below), you can type-check the statically typed parts of a\nprogram like this:\n$ mypy PROGRAM\n\nYou can always use a Python interpreter to run your statically typed\nprograms, even if they have type errors:\n$ python3 PROGRAM\n\nYou can also try mypy in an online playground (developed by\nYusuke Miyazaki).\nIDE, Linter Integrations, and Pre-commit\nMypy can be integrated into popular IDEs:\n\nVim:\n\nUsing Syntastic: in ~\/.vimrc add\nlet g:syntastic_python_checkers=['mypy']\nUsing ALE: should be enabled by default when mypy is installed,\nor can be explicitly enabled by adding let b:ale_linters = ['mypy'] in ~\/vim\/ftplugin\/python.vim\n\n\nEmacs: using Flycheck and Flycheck-mypy\nSublime Text: SublimeLinter-contrib-mypy\nAtom: linter-mypy\nPyCharm: mypy plugin (PyCharm integrates\nits own implementation of PEP 484)\nVS Code: provides basic integration with mypy.\n\nMypy can also be set up as a pre-commit hook using pre-commit mirrors-mypy.\nWeb site and documentation\nDocumentation and additional information is available at the web site:\nhttp:\/\/www.mypy-lang.org\/\nOr you can jump straight to the documentation:\nhttps:\/\/mypy.readthedocs.io\/\nTroubleshooting\nDepending on your configuration, you may have to run pip like\nthis:\n$ python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n\nThis should automatically install the appropriate version of\nmypy's parser, typed-ast.  If for some reason it does not, you\ncan install it manually:\n$ python3 -m pip install -U typed-ast\n\nIf the mypy command isn't found after installation: After\npython3 -m pip install, the mypy script and\ndependencies, including the typing module, will be installed to\nsystem-dependent locations.  Sometimes the script directory will not\nbe in PATH, and you have to add the target directory to PATH\nmanually or create a symbolic link to the script.  In particular, on\nmacOS, the script may be installed under \/Library\/Frameworks:\n\/Library\/Frameworks\/Python.framework\/Versions\/<version>\/bin\n\nIn Windows, the script is generally installed in\n\\PythonNN\\Scripts. So, type check a program like this (replace\n\\Python34 with your Python installation path):\nC:\\>\\Python34\\python \\Python34\\Scripts\\mypy PROGRAM\n\nWorking with virtualenv\nIf you are using virtualenv,\nmake sure you are running a python3 environment. Installing via pip3\nin a v2 environment will not configure the environment to run installed\nmodules from the command line.\n$ python3 -m pip install -U virtualenv\n$ python3 -m virtualenv env\n\nQuick start for contributing to mypy\nIf you want to contribute, first clone the mypy git repository:\n$ git clone --recurse-submodules https:\/\/github.com\/python\/mypy.git\n\nIf you've already cloned the repo without --recurse-submodules,\nyou need to pull in the typeshed repo as follows:\n$ git submodule init\n$ git submodule update\n\nEither way you should now have a subdirectory typeshed inside your mypy repo,\nyour folders tree should be like mypy\/mypy\/typeshed, containing a\nclone of the typeshed repo (https:\/\/github.com\/python\/typeshed).\nFrom the mypy directory, use pip to install mypy:\n$ cd mypy\n$ python3 -m pip install -U .\n\nReplace python3 with your Python 3 interpreter.  You may have to do\nthe above as root. For example, in Ubuntu:\n$ sudo python3 -m pip install -U .\n\nNow you can use the mypy program just as above.  In case of trouble\nsee \"Troubleshooting\" above.\n\nNOTE: Installing with sudo can be a security risk, please try with flag --user first.\n$ python3 -m pip install --user -U .\n\nWorking with the git version of mypy\nmypy contains a submodule, \"typeshed\". See https:\/\/github.com\/python\/typeshed.\nThis submodule contains types for the Python standard library.\nDue to the way git submodules work, you'll have to do\n  git submodule update mypy\/typeshed\n\nwhenever you change branches, merge, rebase, or pull.\n(It's possible to automate this: Search Google for \"git hook update submodule\")\nTests\nThe basic way to run tests:\n$ pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n$ python2 -m pip install -U typing\n$ .\/runtests.py\n\nFor more on the tests, such as how to write tests and how to control\nwhich tests to run, see Test README.md.\nDevelopment status\nMypy is beta software, but it has already been used in production\nfor several years at Dropbox, and it has an extensive test suite.\nSee the roadmap if you are interested in plans for the\nfuture.\nChangelog\nFollow mypy's updates on the blog: https:\/\/mypy-lang.blogspot.com\/\nIssue tracker\nPlease report any bugs and enhancement ideas using the mypy issue\ntracker: https:\/\/github.com\/python\/mypy\/issues\nIf you have any questions about using mypy or types, please ask\nin the typing gitter instead: https:\/\/gitter.im\/python\/typing\nCompiled version of mypy\nWe have built a compiled version of mypy using the mypyc\ncompiler for\nmypy-annotated Python code. It is approximately 4 times faster than\ninterpreted mypy and is available (and the default) for 64-bit\nWindows, macOS, and Linux.\nTo install an interpreted mypy instead, use:\n$ python3 -m pip install --no-binary mypy -U mypy\n\nIf you wish to test out the compiled version of a development\nversion of mypy, you can directly install a binary from\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/mypyc\/mypy_mypyc-wheels\/releases\/latest.\nHelp wanted\nAny help in testing, development, documentation and other tasks is\nhighly appreciated and useful to the project. There are tasks for\ncontributors of all experience levels.

Use zoom in\/out function (W\/S keys) and camera left, right, up, down translation (U\/H\/J\/K keys). When you have aligned, hit 'X' to use this frame as reference to drive the rest of the animation\nUse the overlay function (Z\/C keys) to match your and avatar's face expressions as close as possible\n\nAlternatively, you can hit 'F' for the software to attempt to find a better reference frame itself. This will slow down the framerate, but while this is happening, you can keep moving your head around: the preview window will flash green when it finds your facial pose is a closer match to the avatar than the one it is currently using. You will see two numbers displayed as well: the first number is how closely you are currently aligned to the avatar, and the second number is how closely the reference frame is aligned.\nYou want to get the first number as small as possible - around 10 is usually a good alignment. When you are done, press 'F' again to exit reference frame search mode.\nYou don't need to be exact, and some other configurations can yield better results still, but it's usually a good starting point.\nConfigure video meeting app\nAvatarify supports any video-conferencing app where video input source can be changed (Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, Slack, ...). Here are a few examples how to configure particular app to use Avatarify.\nSkype\nGo to Settings -> Audio & Video, choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) camera.\n\nZoom\nGo to Settings -> Video and choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) from Camera drop-down menu.\n\nTeams\nGo to your profile picture -> Settings -> Devices and choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) from Camera drop-down menu.\n\nSlack\nMake a call, allow browser using cameras, click on Settings icon, choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) in Video settings drop-down menu.\n\nUninstall\nTo remove Avatarify and its related programs follow the instructions in the Wiki.\nContribution\nOur goal is to democratize photorealistic avatars for video-conferencing. To make the technology even more accessible, we have to tackle the following problems:\n\nAdd support for more platforms (Linux and Mac are already supported).\nRemote GPU support. This is a work in progress.\nPorting to non-CUDA GPUs (Intel integrated GPUs, AMD GPUs, etc) and optimization. The goal is to run Avatarify real-time (at least 10FPS) on modern laptops.\n\nPlease make pull requests if you have any improvements or bug-fixes.\nFAQ\nQ: Do I need any knowledge of programming to run Avatarify?\nA: Not really, but you need some beginner-level knowledge of the command line. For Windows we recorded a video tutorial, so it\u2019ll be easy to install.\nQ: Why does it work so slow on my Macbook?\nA: The model used in Avatarify requires a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU to perform heavy computations. Macbooks don\u2019t have such GPUs,  and for processing use CPU, which has much less computing power to run Avatarify smoothly.\nQ: I don\u2019t have a NVIDIA GPU, can I run it?\nA: You still can run it without a NVIDIA GPU, but with drastically reduced performance (<1fps).\nQ: I have an ATI GPU (e.g. Radeon). Why does it work so slow?\nA: To run the neural network Avatarify uses PyTorch library, which is optimized for CUDA. If PyTorch can\u2019t find a CUDA-enabled GPU in your system it will fallback to CPU. The performance on the CPU will be much worse.\nQ: How to add a new avatar?\nA: It\u2019s easy. All you need is to find a picture of your avatar and put it in the avatars folder. More.\nQ: My avatar looks distorted.\nA: You need to calibrate your face position. Please follow the tips or watch the video tutorial.\nQ: Can I use a cloud GPU?\nA: This is work in progress. See the relevant discussion.\nQ: Avatarify crashed, what to do?\nA: First, try to find your error in the troubleshooting section. If it is not there, try to find it in the issues. If you couldn\u2019t find your issue there, please open a new one using the issue template.\nQ: Can I use Avatarify for commercial purposes?\nA: No. Avatarify and First Order Motion Model are licensed under Creative Commons Non-Commercial license, which prohibits commercial use.\nQ: What video conferencing apps does Avatarify support?\nA: Avatarify creates a virtual camera which can be plugged into any app where video input source can be changed (Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, Slack, ...).\nQ: Where can I discuss Avatarify-related topics with the community?\nA: We have Slack. Please join: \nTroubleshooting\nPlease follow the Wiki page.\n","224":"\n\n\n\n    An Apache 2.0 NLP research library, built on PyTorch, for developing state-of-the-art deep learning models on a wide variety of linguistic tasks.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\nWebsite\nGuide\nDocumentation ( latest | stable | master )\nForum\nStack Overflow\nContributing Guidelines\nOfficially Supported Models\n\nPretrained Models\nDocumentation ( latest | stable | master )\n\n\nContinuous Build\nNightly Releases\n\nGetting Started Using the Library\nIf you're interested in using AllenNLP for model development, we recommend you check out the\nAllenNLP Guide.  When you're ready to start your project, we've\ncreated a couple of template repositories that you can use as a starting place:\n\nIf you want to use allennlp train and config files to specify experiments, use this\ntemplate. We recommend this approach.\nIf you'd prefer to use python code to configure your experiments and run your training loop, use\nthis template. There are a few\nthings that are currently a little harder in this setup (loading a saved model, and using\ndistributed training), but otherwise it's functionality equivalent to the config files\nsetup.\n\nIn addition, there are external tutorials:\n\nHyperparameter optimization for AllenNLP using Optuna\nTraining with multiple GPUs in AllenNLP\n\nAnd others on the AI2 AllenNLP blog.\nPlugins\nAllenNLP supports loading \"plugins\" dynamically. A plugin is just a Python package that\nprovides custom registered classes or additional allennlp subcommands.\nThere is ecosystem of open source plugins, some of which are maintained by the AllenNLP\nteam here at AI2, and some of which are maintained by the broader community.\n\n\n Plugin \n Maintainer \n CLI \n Description \n\n\n allennlp-models \n AI2 \n No \n A collection of state-of-the-art models \n\n\n allennlp-semparse \n AI2 \n No \n A framework for building semantic parsers \n\n\n allennlp-server \n AI2 \n Yes \n A simple demo server for serving models \n\n\n allennlp-optuna \n Makoto Hiramatsu \n Yes \n Optuna integration for hyperparameter optimization \n\n\nAllenNLP will automatically find any official AI2-maintained plugins that you have installed,\nbut for AllenNLP to find personal or third-party plugins you've installed,\nyou also have to create either a local plugins file named .allennlp_plugins\nin the directory where you run the allennlp command, or a global plugins file at ~\/.allennlp\/plugins.\nThe file should list the plugin modules that you want to be loaded, one per line.\nTo test that your plugins can be found and imported by AllenNLP, you can run the allennlp test-install command.\nEach discovered plugin will be logged to the terminal.\nFor more information about plugins, see the plugins API docs. And for information on how to create a custom subcommand\nto distribute as a plugin, see the subcommand API docs.\nPackage Overview\n\n\n allennlp \n An open-source NLP research library, built on PyTorch \n\n\n allennlp.commands \n Functionality for the CLI \n\n\n allennlp.common \n Utility modules that are used across the library \n\n\n allennlp.data \n A data processing module for loading datasets and encoding strings as integers for representation in matrices \n\n\n allennlp.modules \n A collection of PyTorch modules for use with text \n\n\n allennlp.nn \n Tensor utility functions, such as initializers and activation functions \n\n\n allennlp.training \n Functionality for training models \n\n\nInstallation\nAllenNLP requires Python 3.6.1 or later. The preferred way to install AllenNLP is via pip.  Just run pip install allennlp in your Python environment and you're good to go!\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f If you're using Python 3.7 or greater, you should ensure that you don't have the PyPI version of dataclasses installed after running the above command, as this could cause issues on certain platforms. You can quickly check this by running pip freeze | grep dataclasses. If you see something like dataclasses=0.6 in the output, then just run pip uninstall -y dataclasses.\n\nIf you need pointers on setting up an appropriate Python environment or would like to install AllenNLP using a different method, see below.\nWe support AllenNLP on Mac and Linux environments. We presently do not support Windows but are open to contributions.\nInstalling via pip\nSetting up a virtual environment\nConda can be used set up a virtual environment with the\nversion of Python required for AllenNLP.  If you already have a Python 3\nenvironment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section.\n\n\nDownload and install Conda.\n\n\nCreate a Conda environment with Python 3.7 (3.6 or 3.8 would work as well):\nconda create -n allennlp python=3.7\n\n\n\nActivate the Conda environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use AllenNLP:\nconda activate allennlp\n\n\n\nInstalling the library and dependencies\nInstalling the library and dependencies is simple using pip.\npip install allennlp\nLooking for bleeding edge features? You can install nightly releases directly from pypi\nAllenNLP installs a script when you install the python package, so you can run allennlp commands just by typing allennlp into a terminal.  For example, you can now test your installation with allennlp test-install.\nYou may also want to install allennlp-models, which contains the NLP constructs to train and run our officially\nsupported models, many of which are hosted at https:\/\/demo.allennlp.org.\npip install allennlp-models\nInstalling using Docker\nDocker provides a virtual machine with everything set up to run AllenNLP--\nwhether you will leverage a GPU or just run on a CPU.  Docker provides more\nisolation and consistency, and also makes it easy to distribute your\nenvironment to a compute cluster.\nAllenNLP provides official Docker images with the library and all of its dependencies installed.\nOnce you have installed Docker,\nyou should also install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit\nif you have GPUs available.\nThen run the following command to get an environment that will run on GPU:\nmkdir -p $HOME\/.allennlp\/\ndocker run --rm --gpus all -v $HOME\/.allennlp:\/root\/.allennlp allennlp\/allennlp:latest\nYou can test the Docker environment with\ndocker run --rm --gpus all -v $HOME\/.allennlp:\/root\/.allennlp allennlp\/allennlp:latest test-install \nIf you don't have GPUs available, just omit the --gpus all flag.\nBuilding your own Docker image\nFor various reasons you may need to create your own AllenNLP Docker image, such as if you need a different version\nof PyTorch. To do so, just run make docker-image from the root of your local clone of AllenNLP.\nBy default this builds an image with the tag allennlp\/allennlp, but you can change this to anything you want\nby setting the DOCKER_TAG flag when you call make. For example,\nmake docker-image DOCKER_TAG=my-allennlp.\nIf you want to use a different version of PyTorch, set the flag DOCKER_TORCH_VERSION to something like\ntorch==1.7.0 or torch==1.7.0+cu110 -f https:\/\/download.pytorch.org\/whl\/torch_stable.html.\nThe value of this flag will passed directly to pip install.\nAfter building the image you should be able to see it listed by running docker images allennlp.\nREPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\nallennlp\/allennlp   latest              b66aee6cb593        5 minutes ago       2.38GB\n\nInstalling from source\nYou can also install AllenNLP by cloning our git repository:\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/allenai\/allennlp.git\nCreate a Python 3.7 or 3.8 virtual environment, and install AllenNLP in editable mode by running:\npip install --editable .\npip install -r dev-requirements.txt\nThis will make allennlp available on your system but it will use the sources from the local clone\nyou made of the source repository.\nYou can test your installation with allennlp test-install.\nSee https:\/\/github.com\/allenai\/allennlp-models\nfor instructions on installing allennlp-models from source.\nRunning AllenNLP\nOnce you've installed AllenNLP, you can run the command-line interface\nwith the allennlp command (whether you installed from pip or from source).\nallennlp has various subcommands such as train, evaluate, and predict.\nTo see the full usage information, run allennlp --help.\nYou can test your installation by running  allennlp test-install.\nIssues\nEveryone is welcome to file issues with either feature requests, bug reports, or general questions.  As a small team with our own internal goals, we may ask for contributions if a prompt fix doesn't fit into our roadmap.  To keep things tidy we will often close issues we think are answered, but don't hesitate to follow up if further discussion is needed.\nContributions\nThe AllenNLP team at AI2 (@allenai) welcomes contributions from the greater AllenNLP community, and, if you would like to get a change into the library, this is likely the fastest approach.  If you would like to contribute a larger feature, we recommend first creating an issue with a proposed design for discussion.  This will prevent you from spending significant time on an implementation which has a technical limitation someone could have pointed out early on.  Small contributions can be made directly in a pull request.\nPull requests (PRs) must have one approving review and no requested changes before they are merged.  As AllenNLP is primarily driven by AI2 (@allenai) we reserve the right to reject or revert contributions that we don't think are good additions.\nCiting\nIf you use AllenNLP in your research, please cite AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform.\n@inproceedings{Gardner2017AllenNLP,\n  title={AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform},\n  author={Matt Gardner and Joel Grus and Mark Neumann and Oyvind Tafjord\n    and Pradeep Dasigi and Nelson F.

Using Wifiphisher, penetration testers can easily achieve a man-in-the-middle position against wireless clients by performing targeted Wi-Fi association attacks. Wifiphisher can be further used to mount victim-customized web phishing attacks against the connected clients in order to capture credentials (e.g. from third party login pages or WPA\/WPA2 Pre-Shared Keys) or infect the victim stations with malwares.\nWifiphisher is...\n\n\n...powerful. Wifiphisher can run for hours inside a Raspberry Pi device\nexecuting all modern Wi-Fi association techniques (including \"Evil Twin\", \"KARMA\" and \"Known Beacons\").\n\n\n...flexible. Supports dozens of arguments and comes with a set of\ncommunity-driven phishing templates for different deployment scenarios.\n\n\n...modular. Users can write simple or complicated modules in Python to expand the functionality of the tool or create custom phishing scenarios in order to conduct specific target-oriented attacks.\n\n\n...easy to use. Advanced users can utilize the rich set of features that Wifiphisher offers but beginners may start out as simply as \".\/bin\/wifiphisher\". The interactive Textual User Interface guides the tester through the build process of the attack.\n\n\n...the result of an extensive research. Attacks like \"Known Beacons\" and \"Lure10\" as well as state-of-the-art phishing techniques, were disclosed by our developers, and Wifiphisher was the first tool to incorporate them.\n\n\n...supported by an awesome community of developers and users.\n\n\n...free. Wifiphisher is available for free download, and also comes with full\nsource code that you may study, change, or distribute under the terms of the\nGPLv3 license.\n\n\nHow it works\nWi-Fi phishing consists of two steps:\n\n\nThe first step involves the process of associating with Wi-Fi clients\nunknowingly, or in other words, obtaining a man-in-the-middle (MITM) position. Wifiphisher uses a number of different techniques to achieve this including:\n\nEvil Twin, where Wifiphisher creates a fake wireless network that looks similar to a legitimate network.\nKARMA, where Wifiphisher masquerades as a public network searched for by nearby Wi-Fi clients.\nKnown Beacons, where Wifiphisher broadcasts a dictionary of common ESSIDs, that the around wireless stations have likely connected to in the past.\n\nAt the same time, Wifiphisher keeps forging \u201cDeauthenticate\u201d or \u201cDisassociate\u201d packets to disrupt existing associations and eventually lure victims using the above techniques.\n\n\nPerforming MiTM attack\n\n\n(Optionally) There are a number of different attacks that can be carried out\nonce Wifiphisher grants the penetration tester with a man-in-the-middle\nposition. For example, the tester may perform data sniffing or scan the victim stations for vulnerabilities.\nUsing Wifiphisher, advanced web phishing techniques are possible by gathering\ninformation from the target environment and victim user. For example, in one of\nour scenarios, Wifiphisher will extract information from the broadcasted beacon\nframes and the HTTP User-Agent header to display a web-based imitation of\nWindows network manager in order to capture the Pre-Shared Key.\n\n\nFake web-based network manager\nRequirements\nFollowing are the requirements for getting the most out of Wifiphisher:\n\nA working Linux system. People have made Wifiphisher work on many distros, but Kali Linux is the officially supported distribution, thus all new features are primarily tested on this platform.\nOne wireless network adapter that supports AP & Monitor mode and is capable of injection. Drivers should support netlink.\n\nInstallation\nTo install the latest development version type the following commands:\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/wifiphisher\/wifiphisher.git # Download the latest revision\ncd wifiphisher # Switch to tool's directory\nsudo python setup.py install # Install any dependencies\nAlternatively, you can download the latest stable version from the Releases page.\nUsage\nRun the tool by typing wifiphisher or python bin\/wifiphisher (from inside the tool's directory).\nBy running the tool without any options, it will find the right interfaces and interactively ask the user to pick the ESSID of the target network (out of a list with all the ESSIDs in the around area) as well as a phishing scenario to perform. By default, the tool will perform both Evil Twin and KARMA attacks.\n\nwifiphisher -aI wlan0 -jI wlan4 -p firmware-upgrade --handshake-capture handshake.pcap\nUse wlan0 for spawning the rogue Access Point and wlan4 for DoS attacks. Select the target network manually from the list and perform the \"Firmware Upgrade\" scenario. Verify that the captured Pre-Shared Key is correct by checking it against the handshake in the handshake.pcap file.\nUseful for manually selecting the wireless adapters. The \"Firmware Upgrade\" scenario is an easy way for obtaining the PSK from a password-protected network.\n\nwifiphisher --essid CONFERENCE_WIFI -p plugin_update -pK s3cr3tp4ssw0rd\nAutomatically pick the right interfaces. Target the Wi-Fi with ESSID \"CONFERENCE_WIFI\" and perform the \"Plugin Update\" scenario. The Evil Twin will be password-protected with PSK \"s3cr3tp4ssw0rd\".\nUseful against networks with disclosed PSKs (e.g. in conferences). The \"Plugin Update\" scenario provides an easy way for getting the victims to download malicious executables (e.g. malwares containing a reverse shell payload).\n\nwifiphisher --essid \"FREE WI-FI\" -p oauth-login -kB\nSimply spawn an open Wi-Fi network with ESSID \"FREE WI-FI\" and perform the \"OAuth Login\" scenario. Furthermore, mount the \"Known Beacons\" Wi-Fi automatic association technique.\nUseful against victims in public areas.

I've written a small doc to describe how to\nget this running in a development setup.\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/dbcli\/mycli\/blob\/master\/CONTRIBUTING.md\nPlease feel free to reach out to me if you need help.\nMy email: amjith.r@gmail.com\nTwitter: @amjithr\nDetailed Install Instructions:\nFedora\nFedora has a package available for mycli, install it using dnf:\n$ sudo dnf install mycli\n\nRHEL, Centos\nI haven't built an RPM package for mycli for RHEL or Centos yet. So please use pip to install mycli. You can install pip on your system using:\n$ sudo yum install python-pip\n\nOnce that is installed, you can install mycli as follows:\n$ sudo pip install mycli\n\nWindows\nFollow the instructions on this blogpost: https:\/\/www.codewall.co.uk\/installing-using-mycli-on-windows\/\nCygwin\n\nMake sure the following Cygwin packages are installed:\npython3, python3-pip.\nInstall mycli: pip3 install mycli\n\nThanks:\nThis project was funded through kickstarter. My thanks to the backers who supported the project.\nA special thanks to Jonathan Slenders for\ncreating Python Prompt Toolkit,\nwhich is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible.\nJonathan has also provided valuable feedback and support during the development\nof this app.\nClick is used for command line option parsing\nand printing error messages.\nThanks to PyMysql for a pure python adapter to MySQL database.\nCompatibility\nMycli is tested on macOS and Linux.\nMycli is not tested on Windows, but the libraries used in this app are Windows-compatible.\nThis means it should work without any modifications.
